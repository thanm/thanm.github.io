          <p>Short ride today, 38 miles, but with a 2000 foot climb to start off with, taking us up over McKenzie pass. It was a beautiful ride, really lovely &ndash; weather was cold to start with but warmed up while we climbed. I rode with Chet and Tom for just about the whole day, also Terence (although he tends to hang back a little on the climbs, so we didn&rsquo;t see all that much of him).</p>
<p>When you get close to the top of the pass there are amazing views of the Sisters (three big peaks) to the south and Mt Washington to the north (very pointy); the landscape is also covered with huge fields of lava, big black chunks. Very striking.</p>
<p>The descent down from the pass was narrow and twisty but the pavement was good, it was definitely a hoot. Also making the downhill more interesting was that there was a bike race coming up as we were coming down &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;Oregon Trail Gravel Grinder&rdquo; race. It was fun to watch the riders: tight pack of about a dozen at the very front, then a huge long tail of other riders.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>The campground in McKenzie Bridge is a USFS one, pretty basic (no electricity, pit toilets, no wifi, etc). Just a place to pitch our tents&hellip; phone calls will wait until tomorrow when we are closer to civilization. Very warm weather here too, it is supposed to hit 93 degrees by 4pm.</p>
<p>Dan and Simona organized a trip to a local hot springs resort after all our riders were in, that was great &ndash; a good hot soak and a nice cold shower afterwards, that did wonders for my disposition.</p>
<p>Tom and Terence are cooking tonight, I believe the theme is going to be be &ldquo;breakfast for dinner&rdquo; (we&rsquo;re reaching the point now where we&rsquo;re piocking our meals based on what we&rsquo;e got lying around in the cooler, which makes sense).</p>
<p>Another riding day down, we now have just three more to go&hellip; ticking down to the end of the trip.</p>

<p>Looking south at the three Sisters (just two are visible from this angle):</p>

<p>Cool poofy flowers we saw on the downhill. These reminded me a lot of the similar flowers we saw during our Wells Gray hiking trip a few years back (although the ones in Wells Gray were a bit smaller):</p>

<p>Race riders zooming by on their way up to the pass during our descent:</p>

<p>The transition between the vegetation on the uphill and the vegetation on the downhill was astonishing &ndash; the rain shadow has an immense effect on dryness levels. Super lush and almost humid feeling after just a few miles into the downhill.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s ride should be an easy one, 55 miles but again mostly downhill. We are heading to Coburg, a Eugene suburb (hoping to do laundry there).</p>
