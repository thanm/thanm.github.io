<p>Lots of nice old iron bridges over the river, including a couple that the trail ran over.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the place we are staying in Pittsburgh &ndash; the <a href="https://www.sstrpgh.com/">Travelers Rest</a> hotel. This place was fantastic, really enjoyed our stay. It is just about custom-made for bikes &ndash; there is a bike garage with tools and lots of storage, a really nice common area where your group can gather, and some excellent rooms. It began life as a cast iron pipe factory back in 1863 (I think), then went through several iterations before being bought and refurbished by the current owners (who are very nice people to boot).</p>

<p>I cooked dinner in the evening with my roommate Theo; that was a certain amount of fun but also a bit stressful since the stove in the TR kitchen was a very underpowered &ndash; I had put up a big pot of red lentil soup and it took more than 50 minutes for it to come to a boil (instead of the expected 15), so things were rather delayed. No matter, I think everyone enjoyed the grub.</p>
<p>380 or so miles down, we have no ridden a tenth of our way across the USA, huzzah!</p>
<p>Zero day tomorrow, yay! Good opportunities for laundry, rest, naps, and other such things.</p>
