          <p>One last ride on the Katy trail, around 63 miles this time. Good weather! A bit on the warm side, but the first few hours were cool at least. Good riding, lots of folks riding in spite of the fact that it was a Tuesday morning. We have reached a total of 1263 miles as of the end of this day, so coming up on one third finished in a few days. We are also coming up on our next zero day this weekend, everyone looking forward to that.</p>
<p>One thing that is interesting about the Katy trail &ndash; from looking at the map it looks as though the main plan when laying out the route was to stay close to the Missouri, but what in fact what it&rsquo;s really tracking is a rock bluff made of white sandy stone that has a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite_(mineral)">Dolomite</a>, a white powdery material.  For big stretches of the trail the river is way off in the distance, but the trail line is right up against this wall of stone. Photo of the bluff:</p>

<p>Excellent early afternoon lunch at the Meriweather Cafe and Bike Store on the trail in Rocheport &ndash; I had a nice sandwich and a small plate of fries.</p>

<p>The ride today:</p>

<p>Stayed in a city park, so no showers and no wifi, bleah. Showers especially missed given that it was a prety hot day. I did a minimal jonb with a washcloth and the sink in the mens room in the park, which was not the greatest.  At map meeting we also heard that the fairgrounds park we&rsquo;re camping at tomorrow also has no showers. Double hmm.</p>
<p>The city for some reason also put us in a segment of the park with very few flat spots for some reason, so I pitched my tent up close to the road and the trailer near one of the few good places. No good deed goes unpunished however because it turned out we were right across the street from a little league field, and they wound up having a double header game that night, complete with lots of traffic, bright lights, plenty of crowd noise. I made a couple of attempts to go to bed but it was pretty much hopeless, so I stayed up until 10:30 when the whole show finally wrapped up and people drove off.</p>
<p>So maybe not the worst night camping on the tour but pretty lousy on the sleeping front.</p>
<p>Tomorrow it will be off the Katy trail and back onto pavement&hellip;</p>
