          <p>Our group was all definitely ready to ride this morning, rest day done with, everyone was packed and ready to hit the road well before schedule. Warm (60) at the start, and sunny.</p>
<p>The ride getting out of Pittsburgh was a bit dicey, we had a very sketchy left turn to get off Carson Ave across a busy highway that was pretty nerve wracking, but we all stuck together in a pack and made it through.</p>
<p>The remainder of the ride was fun but challenging, some real hills this time (one long 4% grade climb and then a couple of nasty 8-10% chunks). Very strong headwind for the last 20 miles, coming along the banks of the Ohio river, also quite hot (80ish). 63 miles total. By the time I finally pulled into Wheeling I my face and legs and other exposed skin were completely coated with salt crystals from the evaporated sweat.</p>
<p>This part of West Virginia has a bit of a &ldquo;rust belt&rdquo; flavor to it, especially the parts along the Ohio river. Hug old coal-fired power plants, giant rusting factories, that sort of thing.  The Ohio itself is huge and muddy, definitely a no-nonsense kind of river.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the small bit I saw of Wheeling; it is clear that it has a good bit of history. Apparently at one point it was the largest manufacturer of iron nails in the country (their local sports teams are all called the Nailers).</p>

<p>Our stay in town was at a church in their &ldquo;parish gym&rdquo;, which basically looked like a middle school gym, attached to the St Alphonsus parish in Wheeling. No need to pitch tents, we just spread out our sleeping pads on the floor and took our chances. No showers, no Wifi, but there was AC thank goodness. Photo:</p>

<p>Arrived in town around 2:30 or so; I was still hungry so I explored for a bit and ran into a long low building called the &ldquo;Wheeling Market&rdquo;, which had a place that sold fried fish sandwiches (yum, that was super tasty). I think my appetite level is starting to ratchet up a bit.</p>
<p>In fact it was a very good thing indeed that we were not tenting it, since shortly after our last rider pulled in it started really raining &ndash; major thunderstorm pulled through, with high winds and real downpours. We were all thanking our lucky stars that we were sleeping indoors under a roof (albeit on the gym floor).</p>
