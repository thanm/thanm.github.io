General observations
I think one of the bigger surprises for most of the folks on the tour was how much cool/cold weather we had. Especially for those on our ride team coming from warmer climates, this was a rude shock: they were thinking about this trip as a summertime experience, but in fact we had a heck of a lot of cold nights and cool mornings to contend with.  [This was partly due to an earlier start (by three weeks) compared with previous years, and partly just because we were up in the mountains a lot in the second half of the trip.]" />

<h2 id="general-observations">General observations</h2>
<p>I think one of the bigger surprises for most of the folks on the tour was how much cool/cold weather we had. Especially for those on our ride team coming from warmer climates, this was a rude shock: they were thinking about this trip as a summertime experience, but in fact we had a heck of a lot of cold nights and cool mornings to contend with.  [This was partly due to an earlier start (by three weeks) compared with previous years, and partly just because we were up in the mountains a lot in the second half of the trip.]</p>
<p>When I was packing I threw a lot of things into my bags thinking &ldquo;Hmm I may not really need this except in the high country&rdquo; but in fact I was glad to have all of my cold weather stuff, no question.</p>
<h2 id="bike-related">Bike-related</h2>
<h3 id="bicycle">Bicycle</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://www.salsacycles.com/products/2022-cutthroat-c-grx-810-2x">Salsa Cutthroat GRX-810</a> bicycle was an absolute rock on this trip, it performed so well for me, I can&rsquo;t say enough nice things about it.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the start of the tour I have to say I was a bit nervous about my bike choice, since virtually everyone else was sporting lightweight road bikes, mostly Trek Domane&rsquo;s of one flavor or another.  I figured I would do well on the gravel but then be at a disadvantage on pavement with my giant clunker of a bike.</p>
<p>In fact because of the way the tires are constructed they did just fine on the roads, I did not feel at all held back for the lengthy stretches on pavement, and the bike was comfortable and performed well even on the longest road rides.</p>
<p>A huge advantage to this bike was its incredibly high degree of reliability &ndash; I spent virtually no time having to tweak it or take care of it, other than a little cleaning now and then and keeping the chain lubricated.  This is in marked contrast to a number of my other teammates, who had to bring their bikes regularly to the shop for one piece of work or another.</p>
<p>Especially worth calling out were the tires &ndash; Teravail Sparwood 2.2&rsquo;s, these guys went the entire journey without any flats if you can believe that, and as I mentioned were ideal both for the pavement sections and the gravel / offroad bits. Super happy with them, I am now a huge fan of the brand.</p>
<p>The gearing (Shimano GRX-810 group) worked out well; I don&rsquo;t feel as though I really needed a bigger gear on the downhills or a smaller gear on the uphills. The handlebars were fine, this particular design has drops that are a bit wider and kind of go out to the side &ndash; I found that I didn&rsquo;t use them at all except on the downhills, but when I was descending the extra width provided some additional stability. Bike felt super stable even up at the high speeds (35/40 mph).</p>
<h3 id="frame-pack-bag">Frame pack bag</h3>
<p>I bought a custom <a href="https://cedaero.com/products/salsa-cutthroat-half-frame-pack-2020-2025?variant=51151627944149">Cedaero half-frame bag</a> for my bike on this tour, and it worked out really well. Fit was spot on (as you would expect for a custom bag) and it worked really well for what I needed it for. Good for storing long skinny things: lock, pump, sunblock, etc; not especially suitable for larger stuff, but that was expected.</p>
<h3 id="fender">Fender</h3>
<p>I used a strap-on (seatpost-attached) plastic rear fender for this trip, no front fender. I think this worked pretty well overall. If the tour had been in a rainier locale I think it would have been better to have real fenders.</p>
<h3 id="blinkies">Blinkies</h3>
<p>I went with two <a href="https://ride.lezyne.com/products/strip-drive-pro-400-plus-rear">Lezyne Strip Drive Pro 400+</a> rear blinkies; I was happy with that combo.  They are quite bright, and the batteries are heavy enough that you can run them for a couple days worth of rides without recharging, although I tended to swap them daily. My only complaint was that the provided mounting hardware makes it difficult to attach them to a seat stay; I think at some point I will try to work on making that happen somehow.</p>
<h3 id="lock">Lock</h3>
<p>You absolutely need a bike lock on these tours; I brought a lightweight model with a key that I had picked out after reading recommendations on a bikepacking web site, but it was not ideal: not large enough (for starters), and it used a key, which I eventually managed to lose (doh), luckily for me when the lock was in my bag and not securing the bike.  A better choice would have been a simple combination cable lock: cheap, effective (e.g. long enough to work in lots of situations) and not very expensive. I wound up buying one of these in Missoula and it served me well.</p>
<h2 id="clothing">Clothing</h2>
<h3 id="bike-shorts">Bike shorts</h3>
<p>My go-to for this tour was a set of <a href="https://www.feedthehabit.com/pearl-izumi-attack-air-bib-shorts-review/">Pearl Izumi Attack Bibs</a>, I would recommend these things to anyone doing a series of long rides. They performed very well and held up to repeated washing/drying and all the other abuse I put them through.</p>
<p>Also brought along a set of cold-weather bike tights, but I never actually used them. My normal cutoff going from shorts to tights is 40 degrees Fahrenheit, if it is 40 or warmer I am much better off without the extra insulation, and although we had a bunch of starts between 40F and 45F it never got below that.</p>
<h3 id="jerseys">Jerseys</h3>
<p>I used generic short-sleeve Pearl Izumi cycling jerseys (set of three), they worked just fine, plus a slightly heavier day-glo long-sleeve jersey (something like this definitely needed for the colder rides).  I wore the long-sleeve one so much that it&rsquo;s pretty stained and ragged at this point, I plan on chucking it once I get home. I think I would also just bring two short-sleeve jerseys instead of three.</p>
<h3 id="cycling-gloves">Cycling gloves</h3>
<p>I brought two pairs of light full-finger gloves, a newer Fox set and an ancient Nashbar generic pair. The Nashbars gradually self-destructed over the course of the tour, and I wound up buying (on a whim) a pair of <a href="https://www.handupco.com/">HandUp</a> gloves in Lander Wyoming.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RmsIxgKPAoFiWKfK_Dl9-CqNY5hd2T17/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>The HandUp gloves immediately became my favorites, I didn&rsquo;t wear anything else for the rest of the trip. Great fit, sturdier than most full-finger gloves out there, really good road feel; highly recommended.</p>
<p>For the colder rides I used a pair of two-layer <a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/collections/mittens/products/arete-modular-gore-tex-mitts-322154">Outdoor Research Mitts</a> with waterproof outers and fleece inners (definitely needed). I only had to use the full combination on one or two rides; for the other cold-weather rides I just used the fleece inner mitts by themselves, which worked very well.</p>
<h3 id="socks">Socks</h3>
<p>I am a die-hard fan of <a href="https://darntough.com">Darn Tough</a> socks for anything active (and in fact anything non-active, these days I don&rsquo;t wear anything else). I brought a half dozen of these guys (mostly mid-weight hikers) and they performed perfectly as always.</p>
<h3 id="hats">Hats</h3>
<p>I brought a ridiculous number of hats on this trip, and I used them all &ndash; don&rsquo;t think I would have left any of them behind. I also layered them on occasion when needed.</p>
<p>The menagerie included (from lightest to heaviest) a set of three Halo synthetic cycling bandanas, an ultralight synthetic runners beanie, a merino wool beanie and neck warmer, a Tilly sun hat, an Outdoor Research cold-weather wind-stopper fleece balaclava, and an Outdoor Research down collapsible down hat. A sampling:</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-CMjpzr-WOiDTU_QctnpxyUk2_w_oSOs/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>On a trip of this length it really helped to have hats to fit every condition.</p>
<p>The collapsible down OR hat was especially helpful for sleeping (colder nights), since you can easily slide it down over your eyes to block out any outside light when in your tent. This was an absolute requirement on many nights for me, since my tent walls are not especially opaque.</p>
<h3 id="long-underwear">Long underwear</h3>
<p>I brought along some el-cheapo synthetic long underwear, long sleeve top and bottom &ndash; I actually kind of threw them into the bag late in the game &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; but in fact I wound up using them constantly, primarily for sleeping. They were great for extra warmth on the colder nights, and in the warmer places I could start out my rest with just the long johns instead of getting into my sleeping bag. Future trans-am riders: don&rsquo;t forget to pack these!</p>
<h3 id="rain-jacket">Rain jacket</h3>
<p>I went with my favorite rain jacket, a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-torrentshell-3-layer-rain-jacket/85241.html">Patagonia Torrentshell</a>. These things are superb jackets, I have worn them now on enough rainy hikes and bike rides that I can vouch for them almost unconditionally &ndash; they have  never let me down (with the caveat that the fabric does tend to degrade after three or four years or so, which I consider expected for modern lightweight rainwear).</p>
<h3 id="down-jacket">Down jacket</h3>
<p>I briefly considered leaving my down jackets at home while I was packing for this trip &ndash; so incredibly glad that I did take one along! Wore it a lot, no question about that. I went with a <a href="https://rab.equipment/us/mens-electron-pro-down-jacket">Rab Electron Pro Jacket</a>. Super warm, very light and packable, good pockets and a good hood design. Don&rsquo;t show up on your next Trans-Am without one&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="boots">Boots</h3>
<p>I was the only rider on the tour not using clip-in cycling shoes, so definitely an oddity there. With my flat pedals I rode with a set of <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/242778/altra-lone-peak-9-waterproof-low-hiking-shoes-mens?sku=2427780025">Altra Lone Peak 9 Waterproof Low Hiking Shoes</a>.</p>
<p>These were a a mixed bag, I have to say. What I found was that my feet tended to get sort of pushed down or compacted with a lot of pressure on my toes, which led to strange blisters + callouses between my toes and a certain amount of foot pain in general.  It was hard to tell whether this was really a problem with the boots themselves, or simply due to the duration of the rides (5+ hours pounding away) and the position or stance of my feet on the pedals when I ride. I suspect it was the latter and not the former.</p>
<p>The waterproofing was also not perfect, it seemed to do great for the first month or so (when we had a lot of rainy rides) but then started to degrade and leak towards the end of the trip.</p>
<p>With that said, I think they did well considering all the abuse I was heaping on them day after day &ndash; it was a very demanding ride.</p>
<h3 id="backup-shoes">Backup shoes</h3>
<p>I brought my Hoka running shoes along as a backup. Not much to note here.</p>
<h2 id="bags">Bags</h2>
<h3 id="day-pack">Day pack</h3>
<p>I went with a <a href="https://www.trucedesigns.com/backpacks/daypack/">Truce Designs daypack</a> for this trip, I was very happy with the pack and would absolutely recommend it for this sort of use.</p>
<p>Truce is a tiny outfit but they make very nice stuff. Very lightweight, waterproof, about the right size, rode well even on the longer rides (normally I would only ride with it if I needed to carry extra rain gear or layers). The zipper is especially good, it doesn&rsquo;t look as though it is waterproof but it certainly was from my experience.</p>
<h3 id="seat-bag">Seat bag</h3>
<p>I went with a small-to-medium sized Ortlieb as my seat bag &ndash; it did ok and was definitely quite waterproof, but looking at the bags other folks had on the trip I think I would have gone with a similar Relevate model if I had a do-over. The Relevate bags are more expandable and make it easier to pack down your gear (including a one-way valve, very handy).</p>
<h3 id="handlebar-bag">Handlebar bag</h3>
<p>I used an el-cheapo generic bag for holding my phone and my lunch; it worked in general but I spent a lot of time fiddling with the zipper. I think for my next long tour I will try to find something a bit more technical with something that attaches more securely and opens more easily.</p>
<h3 id="duffles">Duffles</h3>
<p>Couple of generic duffle bags were all I needed, no special requirements here.</p>
<h2 id="camping-related">Camping related</h2>
<h3 id="tent">Tent</h3>
<p>I used my trusty <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/duplex-tent">ZPacks Duplex</a> ultralight backpacking tent for this jaunt. It performed admirably (there are good reasons why this model is so popular with thru-hikers); I was very happy with it, although I think if I had a do-over I would have brought something slightly larger. Several of my fellow riders went with a Mountain Hardware Mineral King 2P tent, which I think was probably a better choice (sturdier, just as waterproof, a bit bigger).</p>
<h3 id="sleeping-bag">Sleeping bag</h3>
<p>I went with a fairly lightweight bag, a <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/backpacking-sleeping-bag/nemo-kyan-35">Nemo Kyan</a> that I bought a bit more than five years ago. It is rated as a 35 degree bag, but I think that is essentially a fictional number, I think around 45 degrees is really the lower limit for it (at 40 you will be pretty chilly). On the plus side it is extremely lightweight, 1.8 pounds or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Given the warmth limitation I also brought along a second bag, a 50-degree &ldquo;overbag&rdquo;, so on the really cold nights I would put my Nemo inside that thing and the combination pretty much did the trick.</p>
<p>In hindsight I think I should have just brought single &ldquo;real&rdquo; 30-degree down bag and just slept in long-johns on the warmer nights when the bag would be too hot.</p>
<h3 id="sleeping-pad">Sleeping pad</h3>
<p>Started off with a Sea-To-Summit self-inflating pad, very comfy and capacious but also not 100% reliable; it failed after a few weeks and I had to buy a new pad from REI in Pittsburgh. I picked one out based on what they had available there in the store, so not a whole lot of choices.</p>
<p>New pad is an REI <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/216296/rei-co-op-camp-dreamer-xl-self-inflating-deluxe-bed">&ldquo;Camp Dreamer XL Self-inflating Deluxe&rdquo;</a> &ndash; super comfy but also quite big and bulky (would not even fit inside my regular duffel). I would recommend for car camping but probably not for anything where you have to carry it around a lot.</p>
<h3 id="pillow">Pillow</h3>
<p>Generic small-sized travel pillow from Walmart. Worked just fine; I don&rsquo;t need a big pillow but I am not a huge fan of the inflatables, I would rather have a real one (just on a much smaller scale).</p>
<h3 id="dry-bags">Dry bags</h3>
<p>These are an absolute requirement in my mind &ndash; I brought a couple of small ones initially but immediately bought more during our zero day in Pittsburgh, they are an essential backup in case you get water in your tent as a result of a heavy rain storm.  I used three 20-liter Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil bags, that did the trick for me.</p>
<h3 id="headlamp">Headlamp</h3>
<p>Lots of nights in tents, so a headlamp was very handy, I used mine a lot. I recommend the ones from <a href="https://nitecorestore.com/collections/headlamps/products/nitecore-nu20-classic-usb-c-lightweight-outdoor-headlamp">Nitecore</a>, served me well on this trip.</p>
<h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal stuff</h2>
<h3 id="sunblock">Sunblock</h3>
<p>All hail <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/sunscreen-spray-spf-50-095003">Trader Joe&rsquo;s SPF50 Spray Sunscreen</a>! This stuff is awesome, I don&rsquo;t use anything else these days. I went through two cans on the trip, and it performed admirably.</p>
<h3 id="insect-repellent">Insect repellent</h3>
<p>Sawyer Picaridin spray worked well for me.  Surprisingly I only used it a couple of times, but when I needed it, it worked.</p>
