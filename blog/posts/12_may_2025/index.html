<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed riding on my own for this trail since you tend to see more wildlife, and today I saw all sorts of things &ndash; birds, rabbits, a mama groundhog with her pups, deer, hawks, turtles, you name it.  I had at least a dozen sitings of Indigo Buntings (or at least I assume that&rsquo;s what they were) &ndash; tiny bird, slate bklue on the sides, lighter blue on top, very lovely.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Turner Katy Trail Shelter, a charitably-maintained trail house with bunk beds, showers, a tiny kitchen, a few electrical plugs, and not much else.  Our group was of course all pleased as punch, since it meant we could spend a night without having to pitch and then take down our tents. Photo:</p>

<p>Weather was nice &ndash; breezes, 70&rsquo;s, not too buggy.</p>
<p>There was one other person sharing the shelter with us, as hiker who was doing the Katy trail on foot in the other direction (West to East). Nice guy, it was fun to get his perspective, although I have to say I don&rsquo;t think I would ever try to do that particular hike &ndash; not enough interesting stuff along the trail, compared to hikes you can do in the mountains.</p>
