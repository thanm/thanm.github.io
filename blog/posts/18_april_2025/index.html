<p>I limped home for the last two miles and made it up to our driveway. Later that afternoon I brought my bike to the shop to see what they could do for it. There was much head-scratching on the part of the bike mechanics &ndash; this is apparently a pretty unusual failure, and the bolts in question were very obscure. I had a nervous 15 minutes or so waiting while they scrounged around in the back of the shop, eventually locating some parts that should (in theory) work.</p>
<p>Mechanical failures kind of go with the territory for biking &hellip; but hopefully there won&rsquo;t be too many more of these while I am out on the road (gulp).</p>
