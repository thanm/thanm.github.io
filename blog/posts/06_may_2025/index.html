	<meta name="description" content="Started raining steadily this morning around 5am, so we had our first &ldquo;pack up and go&rdquo; in the rain for the trip (we&rsquo;ve had lots of other rainy episodes, but for some reason not in the morning). I am getting good now at managing dry-bags and garbage bags to keep the wet stuff separate from the dry in my luggage.
At the start:


Riding:


It was really a beast of a ride today, no question. 71 miles, 2241 elevation, plenty of up and down. First 20 miles in the rain (bit cold too), all geared up, then at some point it cleared and we started peeling off layers. Second 50 miles was into a serious headwind, really challenging in parts. We were also on a busy road (state route 44) for a couple of long sections, including one where there was a not only a tiny shoulder but with rumble strips, and lots of traffic." />

<p>I did most of the ride with Mike, a very strong rider, so we drafted a bit and did our best. Stopped in Homer IN at a small outfit that manufactured and sold cherry wood furniture (&ldquo;Sampler&rdquo;). We chatted up the lady there for a bit. Lovely stuff, beautifully crafted.</p>

<p>Our camp is in the city of Franklin IN, in one of their town parks (&ldquo;Province Park&rdquo;). So far looks great, nice setting, good weather, breeze. It was good to get our all my wet stuff and let it dry in the sun + breeze. Photo:</p>
