          <p>It was a good vibe this morning, my fellow riders and I were refreshed having spent the night in a high school gym (as opposed to in a tent in the rain), and looking forward to our upcoming zero day. It was cold when we started out but eventually warmed up as we made our way to Fort Collins.</p>
<p>Still on SR 14 for most of the ride, so lots of traffic and beaucoup trucks (ugh) but the shoulder was wide, albeit with debris in some sections.</p>
<p>A bit before the oddly named town of Ault (&ldquo;A Unique Little Town&rdquo; apparently) we looked up ahead and saw a weather balloon rising into the sky, that was a surprise. Couple of photos (you can barely make out the balloon, it was almost a dot by the time I got my camera on it). Pulled over to chat with the folks who had launched it &ndash; turned out to be a startup weather tech company based in Denver that was working on new technology of some sort. They were very tight-lipped about the nature of their innovative new stuff heh.</p>

<p>A bit later than that, still before Ault, we were riding along the road and spotted a cyclist coming the other day &ndash; I waved and continued on, then I heard a yell from the pack of riders behind me, so I slowed down and stopped. Turned out it was Stephen, the son of our fellow rider Tom, who had ridden out to meet us. He joined us for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>In Ault we had a nice stop at Gray&rsquo;s cafe, good coffee and cinnamon rolls with super friendly service.</p>

<p>Changing a flat just outside of Ault (ironically it was Stephen whose back tire had the bad luck in this instance, on a bike he had borrowed no less).</p>

<p>Fort Collins is a nice looking town, weather was cool and sunny, lots of useful stores and restaurants and all with a very bike-friendly vibe.  At the checkin desk the lady behind the counter handed over a package from Amy filled with nice stuff &ndash; snacks, bike gear (replacement eyeglasses mirror, yay) and other goodies. Very nice to get that!</p>
<p>We visited REI and various bike shops in the afternoon, got a lot of stuff squared away in that department. I picked up a package of tent parts that I&rsquo;d had mailed to me (after waiting in an interminable line at the post office), and I bought a new sleeping pad top replace my ailing Sea-To-Summit model.</p>
<p>Dinner at <a href="https://avogadros.com/">Avogadro&rsquo;s Number</a> not far from our motel, a good pick suggested by former ACA guy Ray (who also bailed us out by helping us buy a new french press coffee maker). Food and atmosphere were excellent.</p>
