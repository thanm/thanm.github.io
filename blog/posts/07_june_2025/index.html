          <p>Huge cycling day today &ndash; 70 miles, 3700 feet of elevation gain and some pretty consistent, stiff headwinds made for a really exhausting ride (total of seven hours of riding time). We crossed Togwotee pass (elevation 9567), so that was the huge climb for the day. The grades on the climb were not too horrendous, mostly between 4 and 6 percent, but it was a really long haul getting up and over.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the views of the Tetons during the descent were really breath-taking, and the weather was clear and sunny and perfect, so it was hard to avoid stopping to take pictures on the way down. I have never visited this particular national park, so it was a treat to get all the nice views of the peaks.</p>
<p>We also played tag again with the Dutch couple that we&rsquo;ve been seeing on the rides that last few days; it was good to chat with them again. They are going to be wrapping up their tour tomorrow morning so I suspect this will be our last encounter.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Campground is functional but a far cry from the nice place we stayed at in Dubois &ndash; kinda crowded, showers are $5 in a central depot that&rsquo;s a 15 minute walk away (ugh), and it is pretty buggy unfortunately. I think that&rsquo;s kind of what you&rsquo;re in for when you visit national park campgrounds; there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of appetite for infrastructure improvements in national parks in DC these days. With that said, the surroundings are awesome (which of course is why all the other visitors are here).</p>

<p>Mike and Theo cooked this evening, they did a nice job with a limited time budget (fish sticks, mini meat-loaf patties, green beans, and potatoes).</p>
<p>We have a zero day tomorrow; I thought briefly about going for a hike, but I think I might settle for just an extended laundry session for starters, then see how I feel.</p>
