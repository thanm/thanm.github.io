	<meta name="description" content="Final ride today on the tour! It was a 66 miler with a wheel dip in the Pacific around mile 35 or so, just south of Waldport, total riding time a bit short of five hours. Plenty of elevation gain (3000&#43;), all of it in the form of up-and-down small hills (just a ton of them). Terrain reminiscent of our riding in eastern Ohio.
The first section (30 miles or so) was following the Alsea river down to the coast, a winding two-lane road with not the greatest shoulder, but nice trees and wildlife. Got a good look at a pair of big red-headed woodpeckers a bit before mile 10 or so; riding with Terence and Tom for that section." />

          <p>Final ride today on the tour! It was a 66 miler with a wheel dip in the Pacific around mile 35 or so, just south of Waldport, total riding time a bit short of five hours. Plenty of elevation gain (3000+), all of it in the form of up-and-down small hills (just a ton of them). Terrain reminiscent of our riding in eastern Ohio.</p>
<p>The first section (30 miles or so) was following the Alsea river down to the coast, a winding two-lane road with not the greatest shoulder, but nice trees and wildlife. Got a good look at a pair of big red-headed woodpeckers a bit before mile 10 or so; riding with Terence and Tom for that section.</p>
<p>The ride as recorded by my phone &ndash; this was another one where some sort of strange software glitch added a bunch of phantom/nonexistent hills + miles to my real ride: all the strange jaggedy stuff from &ldquo;mile 6&rdquo; to &ldquo;mile 35&rdquo; is not really there:</p>

<p>Mouth of the Alsea river near Waldport:</p>

<p>NB: Not super impressed with Oregon drivers on this ride, my compadres and I were buzzed (close calls drive-by&rsquo;s) more than once, mostly by people in big pickup trucks, and in situations where there wasn&rsquo;t any oncoming traffic either. Can&rsquo;t really explain it &ndash; maybe these folks were bitten on the leg by a rabid cyclist when they were little? Or maybe had some other bad experience with a bike that left them with unresolved anger issues? Who knows.</p>
<p>At Waldport we met up at a food store, made sure everyone was there, then rode together down to a beach campground about 4 miles south and stopped for our official &ldquo;wheel dip&rdquo;. Photos:</p>

<p>Views of the Pacific from the ride &ndash; very beautiful stretch of coastline along here, quite lovely indeed.</p>

<p>I rode with Chet&rsquo;s triangle today as well as my own &ndash; he and Mel were with me on the ride in spirit, I was thinking of them.</p>

<p>Tonight we have a group dinner planned out, which I am looking forward to (camp cooking now pretty old), then one more night in the tent, and a van ride back to Eugene tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hard to believe we finally made it &ndash; it has been such a long haul getting here&hellip; an amazing experience in so many ways.</p>
