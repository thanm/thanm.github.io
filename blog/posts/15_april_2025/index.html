          <p>Hi all, welcome to the blog I&rsquo;m keeping to document the Trans-America bike ride I&rsquo;m doing this summer. Although I&rsquo;ve created a lot of content using <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger/Blogspot</a>, I decided this time around to &ldquo;roll my own&rdquo; so as to have a bit more control (you can click on the &ldquo;about&rdquo; link above for more of the grubby details).</p>
<p>A photo of my trusty bike:</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJrArLVhnGpVSTUgu6jqAlPfBw9TKDoa/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>This is a <a href="https://www.salsacycles.com/products/2022-cutthroat-c-grx-810-2x">Salsa Cutthroat</a>, a bike in theory designed for long-distance gravel rides (in particular the <a href="https://tourdivide.org/">Tour Divide</a> route).  Carbon fiber frame to keep the weight down, but in other respects a high level of sturdiness for dealing with rough roads and such.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to capture each ride (the GPS track) and upload it so that you can see where I&rsquo;ve been. Here&rsquo;s an example training ride I did here in Arlington:</p>
<iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=trip&amp;id=270432952&amp;sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>The data for the page above was generated by a Garmin Edge 130 (very minimalista GPS-enabled bike computer) and then uploaded to <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/">Ride With GPS</a>.  It&rsquo;s a nice way to summarize a ride &ndash; shows the route as well as the elevation (and shows in embarassing detail just how slowly you had to ride in order to get over that big hill, heh).</p>
<p>This tour is sponsored/run by the Adventure Cycling Association, here is a <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/van-supported-tours/transam-express-westward-van/">link</a> that has more details on the ride itself (route and such).</p>
<p>A heads-up that I won&rsquo;t be trying to post every day, I don&rsquo;t think I will have the bandwidth for that &ndash; also, a sizeable fraction of the campsites we&rsquo;re staying at don&rsquo;t have WIFI (some of them probably won&rsquo;t even have cell reception).  Also: although my new blogging platform has many desirable qualities, adding photos is a bit tricky (requires a lot of manual steps) so I may need to be a bit more stingy with pictures for a bit until I iron that out.</p>
<p>Very excited to begin my ride, stay tuned for more posts once things get kicked off&hellip;</p>
