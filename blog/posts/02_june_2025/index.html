	<meta name="description" content="Today we rode from Walden Colorado to Saratoga Wyoming, so a new state, huzzah! A total of 69 miles, 2,542 feet of elevation gain &ndash; a fairly challenging ride by the numbers.
The landscape changed a bit as we rode north, maybe a bit drier and vegetation more scrubby than the North Park area we were in before.
Weather-wise this was a &ldquo;Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde&rdquo; ride &ndash; first 30 miles (kindly Dr Jeckyl) we had a modest tailwind, sailing along with ease. Then lo and behold around the 30 mile mark the wind turned around and we were riding into a 7-10mph headwind (horrible Mr Hyde). Lots of work from then on to keep up a reasonable pace.  Legs pretty sore when we were done&hellip;" />

          <p>Today we rode from Walden Colorado to Saratoga Wyoming, so a new state, huzzah! A total of 69 miles, 2,542 feet of elevation gain &ndash; a fairly challenging ride by the numbers.</p>
<p>The landscape changed a bit as we rode north, maybe a bit drier and vegetation more scrubby than the North Park area we were in before.</p>
<p>Weather-wise this was a &ldquo;Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde&rdquo; ride &ndash; first 30 miles (kindly Dr Jeckyl) we had a modest tailwind, sailing along with ease. Then lo and behold around the 30 mile mark the wind turned around and we were riding into a 7-10mph headwind (horrible Mr Hyde). Lots of work from then on to keep up a reasonable pace.  Legs pretty sore when we were done&hellip;</p>
<p>Just as with our ride yesterday it started to cloud up around 11, and by 1pm or so there were intermittent bits of rain, but this time not a whole lot, we only had a couple of drops along the way.</p>
<p>Ride map:</p>

<p>If you look west from Walden on the map above you&rsquo;ll see that the mountains directly to the west are the Zirkel range; Amy and I did a family hiking trip in this part of the Rockies back in the 90s; I remember it as a very wild, remote wilderness. We hiked the entire time there without seeing another soul, as I recall (which makes sense, given how long it takes to get there from Denver).</p>
<p>Entering Wyoming:</p>

<p>Terrence just before Saratoga:</p>

<p>Instead of a campground, our destination for this ride was the Saint Barnabus Episcopalian church. They stashed us in one of the church outbuildings, a house with enough bedrooms to hold our gang (just barely) and a kitchen + dining area below. Very nice digs, super happy that they were willing to put us up.</p>

<p>Once we had settled in, a bunch of us went out to visit the local hot springs pool, about a half mile away on the banks of the river.</p>

<p>Couple of good-sized concrete bathing pools fed by hot springs, water was <em>very</em> hot.  One of the folks I chatted with there said that it was around 111 degrees F, which is almost scalding. I stayed in for 5 or 6 minutes, then walked over to the river (the North Platte) and took a nice cold plunge, then repeated the process.</p>

<p>Tim and Simona cooking tonight, we&rsquo;ll see what they come up with. I almost always enjoy Simona&rsquo;s meals since she pays real attention to the vegetable part of the meal (makes sense as a vegetarian).</p>
