          <p>This was an interesting &ldquo;up and down and up&rdquo; ride &ndash; lengthy climb up to the top of a pass, then descent down into Hell&rsquo;s Canyon and along the Snake river, and then another climb getting back up out of the canyon and into the high plains again. Around 60 miles with a chunky 3600 feet of elevation gain. Weather behaved itself for the most part.

<p>It was threatening rain the whole way from mile 45 or so to mile 60 (coming up out of the canyon), but it never really amounted to much. A couple of times we stopped and put on all our rain gear&hellip; then 10 minutes later we had to stop and take it off again (getting too hot with it on).</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>The Hell&rsquo;s Canyon part was very scenic but kind of stark, there is only a little in the way of green growing stuff down in the canyon. Lots of people towing boats around on their cars getting ready to put in or having just taken out.</p>
<p>At mile 32 we crossed over the Snake river and offiically arrived in our final new state: Oregon &hellip; huzzah!  Feels weird to not have any others on deck.</p>
<p>Couple of shots of the Brownlee Reservoir (formed by a dam on the Snake):</p>

<p>Snake river! A big one:</p>

<p>&hellip; and we made it to Oregon, our final state&hellip;  huzzah!</p>

<p>A shot looking to the southwest while riding to Halfway (almost there):</p>

<p>Halfway OR has a very small-town agricultural feel to it; I haven&rsquo;t yet explored the main drag, but it looks fairly basic.</p>
<p>The Halfway Motel and RV park (pretty much the only option in town) is pretty basic, no wifi and a bit small / primitive. On the plus side the shower was nice and hot. Coupla photos (the RV Park sign was a classic, looks right out of the 1950s):</p>

<p>Dan and Theo cooking dinner tonight&hellip; I&rsquo;ve was recruited to work on the tofu part of the meal, which eventually morphed into doing the chicken as well (I was happy to help). The end result:</p>

<p>Baker City Oregon tomorrow, and then a zero day &hellip; looking forward to that as usual.</p>
