I spent the morning helping Theo (our rider from the Netherlands) wrangle with the people at the cell phone store to get a US cell plan, that was quite the electronic adventure.  I had done a little research ahead of time to make sure his phone was compatible, but there was still a lot of drama and complication. The person behind the counter needed lots of nudging and arm-twisting (I think what they really wanted was for him to buy a new phone, but that was not going to happen)." />

<p>I spent the morning helping Theo (our rider from the Netherlands) wrangle with the people at the cell phone store to get a US cell plan, that was quite the electronic adventure.  I had done a little research ahead of time to make sure his phone was compatible, but there was still a lot of drama and complication. The person behind the counter needed lots of nudging and arm-twisting (I think what they really wanted was for him to buy a new phone, but that was not going to happen).</p>
<p>I thought about venturing out to visit the Carnegie art museum, but for some reason my left foot was not in good shape (combination of blisters and a stubbed toe), so I opted for staying local.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we kick off a four day run into Ohio and Indiana, and then after that we have an uninterrupted 13 day stretch without a rest day, whee :-).</p>
