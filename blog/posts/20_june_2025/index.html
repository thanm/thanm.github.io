Second surprise: the original RV park we were going to be riding to in Riggins (&ldquo;Big Eddy&rdquo;) canceled our reservation, so Dan &#43; Simona had to rebook us in a new place. The fallback campground is named &ldquo;Pinehurst&rdquo;, and is about 13 miles past Riggins, so what was originally going to be a 50 mile ride turned into a 63 mile ride.

          <p>We had some surprises/curveballs to deal with in our ride planning today.</p>
<p>First was that Simona managed to come down with the cold that Dan and I had (Dan is still wrestling with it, but I am almost done). Bummer&hellip; hope that will be the end of it and that other folks won&rsquo;t get infected.</p>
<p>Second surprise: the original RV park we were going to be riding to in Riggins (&ldquo;Big Eddy&rdquo;) canceled our reservation, so Dan + Simona had to rebook us in a new place. The fallback campground is named &ldquo;Pinehurst&rdquo;, and is about 13 miles past Riggins, so what was originally going to be a 50 mile ride turned into a 63 mile ride. The extra distance today is in fact just fine, since it will make tomorrow&rsquo;s ride into Cambridge much more manageable (no longer 80 but now 67).</p>
<p>Ride:</p>
<iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=trip&amp;id=298524925&amp;sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>The weather also was a factor today &ndash; very overcast in the morning with occasional showers predicted, so we all made sure to pack our rain gear for the ride. Sure enough, about half an hour in it began to rain, nothing incredibly heavy but enough that you wanted something waterproof to wear.</p>
<p>After about four miles or so we turned off the busy 95 highway and onto &ldquo;Old 95&rdquo;, much smaller and twistier; it looped up into the hills and we had a steady climb up to a summit. The climb was manageable, and I finally felt like I had some of my usual energy back (after many days without it due to my cold). Shortly after the top &ldquo;old&rdquo; 95 dumped us back onto the main 95, which was a bit busy/scary, but almost immediately the route took us back onto the side roads for a big descent down into the valley.</p>
<p>Really glorious descent, lots of switchbacks and hairpins, big dark clouds in the mountains off to the east (with occasional lightning), but fantastic views down into the valley to the south. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on why it was so beautiful, but it just was &ndash; kind of a &ldquo;desert after the rain&rdquo; feel.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the descent was the Nez Perce town of White Bird, very rustic and one-horse, but it sported a really good cafe (&ldquo;Red&rsquo;s Kitchen&rdquo;) where I stopped for a bite. Tim was already there and digging into some eggs when I arrived. Food was excellent, almost too good (I think if that place was within walking distance in my neighborhood I would be visiting a couple of days every week :-).</p>
<p>Sign marking a Nez Perce battlefield. I went over to explore it, but it would have required a bit too much walking to get to the interesting parts.</p>

<p>Bridge carrying new 95 over White Bird. A sort of weird metaphor for how the town is being bypassed by &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Idaho?</p>

<p>From there we had maybe another four miles on the smaller roads until finally getting deposited back onto big route 95 again. The shoulder was a mixed bag; it was generally wide enough but they had chosen to put the rumble strips right in the center of it, so there were sections where you had to ride really carefully (and there was a good deal of traffic too).</p>
<p>At this point we got our first good look at the Salmon river, yet another incredibly beautiful Idaho river (they seem to be very blessed here in that department). Large, dark, fast-flowing &hellip; also (oddly) headed north, which seemed weird to me for some reason (it eventually turns to the west and empties out into the Snake, which then goes south).</p>
<p>After four or five miles the valley walls sort of narrowed in and it was just the highway on one side (sometimes carved into the hillside) and the river on the other, kind of a cool look.</p>
<p>I saw an osprey flying over at one point holding a fish, that was neat &ndash; not too much other plant or animal life though, the canyon was pretty sparse.</p>

<p>The RV park here is pretty basic, we have a smallish area for our tents (things will be a bit crowded), an odd cubby-cubicle thing with a toilet (somehow reminds me of the Tardis from Dr Who) and a single small shower buried in the interior of a utility building. With that said, the tent area is mostly level, and the shower was hot, yay.</p>
<p>Camping area at the Pinehurst RV park:</p>

<p>The weird bathroom cubby/cubicle thing in Pinehurst. We were hoping for a sink and faucets but no such luck:</p>

<p>The WiFi here however is pretty atrocious, things take forever and a day to load, so I think I suspect I may need to postpone filling out my blog post with photos until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mel did a reprise of his fish tacos meal from the first week &ndash; just as delicious as the first time around, yum.</p>
<p>Skies started to cloud up around 6, started raining around 6:30, at which point I beat a hasty exit to my tent. Simona rousted everyone to do the map meeting (in the pouring rain &ndash; this RV park has no place to shelter); it was a pretty brief one, everyone wanted to get back in their tents.</p>
