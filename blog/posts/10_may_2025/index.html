          <p>Today was a final push through Illinois, riding all the way up to the town of Alton (a St Louis suburb) on the banks of the Mississippi. This was about a 75 mile ride, split halfway between SR40/SR140 and a set of smaller roads and bike trails towards the end of the ride. Again we had great riding conditions, sunny, favorable breezes.

<p>The church that we were supposed to stay at in Alton apparently had a conflict, they were putting on an event, so we got booted out into a nearby Super 8 motel &ndash; not the Ritz, but nicer than camping (no tent needs to be pitched, etc).</p>
<p>On our ride we stopped to eat an early lunch at Greeneville University (in Greeneville):</p>
