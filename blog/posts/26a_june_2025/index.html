<p>I rode with Theo for the first 40 miles or so, that was nice. We chatted about various stuff, I asked him about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfstedentocht">Elfstedentocht</a>, the big ice skating race in the Netherlands (which was last held in 1997) so we talked about that for a while and chewed over various other subjects.</p>
<p>At mile 40 the climbing started, also the headwinds; I wanted to ride ahead so I sped up a bit and rode by myself for the remainder. Very stark, dry landscape &ndash; from around mile 50 on I was looking for a place to stop on the side of the road with some shade, but there was basically nothing until pretty close to the pass.</p>
<p>Our destination here in Mitchell is the Spoke-n-Wheel bike hostel, which looks like a real winner in every way &ndash; nice beds, friendly folks taking care of it, good showers, awesome gathering area, good wifi&hellip; yay. Very happy to stay here.</p>
<p>Riding with Theo:</p>

<p>The start of the uphill was a section in which the road wound through a steep canyon called Picture Gorge &ndash; that was very beautiful&hellip;</p>

<p>There was a potential detour we could have made to the fossil museum (highly rated), but I was focused on finishing before the headwinds really kicked in, so I gave this a pass. Maybe on some other trip to Oregon:</p>

<p>Summit of the pass &ndash; all downhill from here&hellip;</p>

<p>Simona and Terry are cooking tonight &ndash; lucky them, they get to use the nice kitchen in the basement of the hostel. We&rsquo;ll see what they come up with &hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re winding down on the cycling days, we only have six (six!!!!) more riding days left.  The end of the trip is coming up more quickly than I thought.</p>
<p>It feels good to knock off the last few big climbs as well; we have a big one tomorrow, then after that there&rsquo;s mostly the smaller ups and downs and bumps. The final ride to Florence atually has a fair amount of elevation gain, but all all the ups are tiny (no monster 10 mile things to contend with).</p>
