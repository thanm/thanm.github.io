It was a not-too-long ride (53 miles) but with plenty of climbing, 3700 feet of elevation gain. Big climb right off the bat coming out of Halfway, but I actually like my climbs early when it is cool, it was enjoyable. Big downhill, a ride in the valley for a while, then we had long section following the Powder river in a steep, narrow, winding canyon. Then another big climb up through the desert and down into the big valley with Baker City in it." />

<p>It was a not-too-long ride (53 miles) but with plenty of climbing, 3700 feet of elevation gain. Big climb right off the bat coming out of Halfway, but I actually like my climbs early when it is cool, it was enjoyable. Big downhill, a ride in the valley for a while, then we had long section following the Powder river in a steep, narrow, winding canyon. Then another big climb up through the desert and down into the big valley with Baker City in it.</p>
<p>Terrain very dry, desert-like aside from the few bits of green stuff growing near the rivers and creeks. There are occasional farms, but all the fields are heavily irrigated.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Climbing up out of Halfway in the first part of the ride:</p>

<p>Riding in the canyon alongside the Powder river, carving around the turns:</p>

<p>We passed this along the way, around 8 miles outside of Baker City. Apparently this area figures big in the history of the Oregon trail, we might take a look at it tomorrow:</p>

<p>Field of potatoes growing a couple of miles from Baker City &ndash; weirdly, we didn&rsquo;t see any potatoes in the fields in Idaho, but then lo and behold we get a blob of them right off the bat in Oregon.</p>

<p>The campground, &ldquo;Mountain View RV&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Looking forward to a zero day tomorrow, all the usual stuff: laundry, being a potted plant, working on my bike, etc. Rest is going to be especially important since day after tomorrow we have a monster ride queued up, the elevation chart for the John Day ride looks like this:</p>

<p>Three big 1000+ foot climbs spread out over an 80+ mile ride, whee&hellip; all I can say is that I hope the winds are favorable.</p>
