          <p>Medium ride today, 59 miles with around 2500 feet of elevation gain. Another spectacular Wyoming vistas ride, lovely scenery, interesting geology, wild horses and deer, not a lot of other human beings (and in particular no shops or cafes to stop at).</p>
<p>Cold in the morning, I had hat + gloves + shell + layers on, but was still working to keep from being too cool. It warmed up a bit in the afternoon and we got some intermittent sunshine.</p>
<p>View to the north on the ride:</p>

<p>Lots of downhill on this ride, including a huge 6+ mile descent mostly at a six percent grade, so a real monster (lots of fun).</p>

<p>My ride recording was again messed up, this time not because of software problems but simply because I forgot to start my recording on time:</p>

<p>Lander seems like a nice city, bustling, lots of places to eat and shop with plenty of younger folks around.</p>
<p>Our teammate Deb lives here in Lander, so she graciously invited us to come and stay with her for our visit, which is fabulous since it is currently raining and rather chilly. They have a lovely spread outside of town perched up in the hills.</p>

<p>Deb&rsquo;s super friendly dog Duncan was there to greet us when we arrived; he was verty glad to have a big gang of slightly stinky bikers show up and give him lots of love and attention. He was also kind enough to &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; my riding shoe for me (as well as one of my hats that I&rsquo;d left on a bench), just for good measure.</p>

<p>After our gang finally all got collected and showered we drove off up into the hills to see Sink Canyon, an interesting riverside park thing where a fairly sizeable river running through a canyon vanishes into a hole in the rocks and then reappears abiout a quarter mile down the hill (very interesting). There is also a big pool in the river with a sort of observation platform where you can walk out above the pool and feed the fish, a set of extremely large trout that have taken up residence (they like being fed, apparently).</p>
<p>River flowing into a hole in the ground (and this a decent sized stream with a lot of water in it):</p>

<p>Pool where the river re-emerges (with enormous trout waiting for treats):</p>

<p>Dinner at Gannet Grill cafe &ndash; great place to eat, food was terrific, but it was super busy and we had to wait quite a while for our meals to arrive (I didn&rsquo;t quite pass out from hunger but it felt as though I was heading in that direction).</p>
<p>Photo taken outside the restaurant, look closely at the top of the building:</p>

<p>Couple of big rides coming up tomorrow and the next day &ndash; I hope my legs will cope. I&rsquo;m also on dinner cooking duty tomorrow so it is going to be a long day for me.</p>
