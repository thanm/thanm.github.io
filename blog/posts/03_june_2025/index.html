          <p>Shorter ride today, 45 miles with 1450ft elevation gain, and a bit less in the headwind department today, thankfully. Cool and overcast, maybe 48 degrees when we started, then about 12 miles into the ride the temperature abruptly dropped ten degrees and the wind picked up, yikes.  Mike and I were riding together at that point, we both realized we were absolutely freezing, so we stopped and threw on extra layers, but still cold after that.</p>
<p>First half of the ride was another dose of classic Wyoming riding, that &ldquo;big sky&rdquo; look, scrubby vegetation, the occasional herd of cattle or collection of antelope or deer.  The rural roads in this state have a very lonely feel to them I must say.</p>
<p>Second half of the ride was on interstate I80, eek. That was really the only option for getting into Rawlins, so that was where the route took us.  In fact however it was not such a bad ride, we were on a pretty decent shoulder and we only had to do a 13 mile stretch.</p>
<p>After that we got off in the town of Sinclair, which is basically an enormous petroleum refinery (has been for about a hundred years) with a few houses tacked onto the side.  They have a town history museum, which Mel and Mike and I went into for a bit, mildly interesting.</p>
<p>We arrived in Rawlins a bit too early to check into the campground (an RV park), so the gang washed up in a strip mall just inside the city limits with a Starbucks and a McDonalds.</p>

<p>Early portion of the ride, this shot is looking east towards the Medicine Bow mountain range:</p>

<p>Riding on I80, this was the general look. Excellent shoulder, enough room that we weren&rsquo;t constantly being buzzed by traffic.</p>

<p>Left I80 at Sinclair, this is a shot of the big refinery there.</p>

<p>As we were riding past the refinery there were a series of rail tracks that crossed the road. I was able to negotiate them ok, but a few seconds later I heard a yelp and a crash and looked back to see that Mel had gone down. He had approached the tracks turned perpendicular to them (as you&rsquo;re supposed to), but didn&rsquo;t see that there were also gaps between the paving tiles and got his wheel caught there. I think I just got lucky (either that or my bigger tires protected me).  Very cycle-unfriendly.  Mel not hurt thankfully, other than a small tear in his jacket.</p>

<p>Sinclair has one of the most active freight rail lines I have seen in some time (maybe ever). Huge, long trains, one after the other. Here&rsquo;s a shot of one, stretching as far as the eye can see:</p>

<p>A few photos from the Sinclair history museum. Up above is an early Sinclair sign, and below is a framed set of photos that were used for refinery employee badges (looking for all the world like mug shots).</p>

<p>Fountain in the main square of the town of Sinclair:</p>

<p>Rawlins (our destination this afternoon) has around eight thousand people, which qualifies it as a large city by Wyoming standards.</p>
<p>We are at an RV campground &ndash; quite a big place, must be the size of a couple of football fields tacked together&hellip; almost empty when I rolled in around 2, but as I write this (4:45pm) it is definitely filling up. Tent camping section is nice, the spots are level (yay).</p>

<p>I had some extra time on my hands this afternoon, so in addition to lubing my bike chain I also worked on my tires. At this point in the tour (2300 miles in) my rear tire was starting to show some wear, whereas the front one looked almost pristine&hellip; so I went ahead and swapped them back to front. Photo post-swap; in the first shot below you can see the wear on the now-front tire if you look carefully:</p>

<p>Hoping that this will do it and I won&rsquo;t need to replace either of them during the tour, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Tom and Terry cooking tonight, should be plenty of good grocery store options. In fact there is even an Asian grocery, which I visited on the way into the RV park.</p>
