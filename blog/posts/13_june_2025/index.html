          <p>Another corker of a ride, this one 68 miles and 3780 feet of elevation gain. There were two big climbs each around 1700 or 1800 feet, first one from mile 20 to 30 and the second from mile 30 to 40, definitely a tough ride. I felt pretty good for the first climb but kind of ran out of gas for the second, I had to use my low granny even though the grade never got worse than around 6.5%.</p>
<p>Lunch in Jackson MT, where they have a sort of hot springs resort thing with a hotel and restaurant. I ate with Mike, then Chet and Mel rolled in just as I was finishing up. Miraculously I was also able to have a video call with Amy, it was around 10:30pm in the evening for her in Estonia, but she was still awake and I was able to make use of the restaurant WiFi. The wonders of technology!</p>
<p>I felt a little better on the last 18 miles or so from Jackson into Wisdom, bit more energy. Also a bit more mosquitos &ndash; to my surprise, a few of the bugs were sufficiently fiesty that they were able to catch up with me on the bike and bite my legs (when the wind turned), sort of a super-power for a bug that size.</p>

<p>Second and taller pass we climbed:</p>

<p>This large and weird-looking gadget is a replica of a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/beaverslide-hay-stacker.htm">machine</a> invented by a local guy a bit before the turn of the century for making bigger and better haystacks (I kid you not). It apparently made its inventor a lot of money.</p>

<p>Wisdom MT is a mighty small town, not a whole lot going on, and from what I can tell just a single not-very-full RV park. Hopefully it will be a quiet place to hang out and get some good rest overnight. After showering I took a drink from the bathroom sink &hellip; only to then reread Dan&rsquo;s text about the RV park, which said that the water was non-potable (oops). Hopefully I won&rsquo;t come down with some horrible ailment. The campground:</p>

<p>Mel and Simona are cooking, they are doing a vegetarian version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian_cuisine#:~:text=Pish%20pash%20was%20defined%20by,%2C%20from%20pashidan%2C%20to%20break.">pish pash</a> with lentils instead of chicken&hellip; should be interesting.</p>
