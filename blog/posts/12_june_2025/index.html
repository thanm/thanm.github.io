The climb to the pass was great &ndash; still cool, good road, sunny and clear, with excellent views back into the Madison River valley behind and to the left.  No wind to speak of on this part of the ride." />

          <p>Another challenging ride today, they seem to be coming thick and fast in this part of the tour. Gone are the 45 and 50 mile days at least for now.</p>
<p>Bit over 71 miles, about 3000 feet of elevation gain, most of it in the first 10 miles as we headed over a pass at roughly 7k feet. Definitely a lot of work, both on paper and in reality.</p>
<p>The climb to the pass was great &ndash; still cool, good road, sunny and clear, with excellent views back into the Madison River valley behind and to the left.  No wind to speak of on this part of the ride.</p>
<p>Steep descent after the pass dumping us out into the town of Virginia City, an old gold mining town as I understand it that still has some of its old storefronts and buildings, so there were some services and cafes there.</p>
<p>From there we rode down into the Alder Creek valley, the site of all the gold mining activity. That was a slightly weird ride, the landscape looked like it was still recovering from a massive air-based bombing campaign, or perhaps an attack by a team of mentally deranged backhoe operators &ndash; enormous holes and trenches, big piles of rocks/dirt/gravel all over the place. From the signage along the road it sounds as though this area was one where they were were actively developing and using the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_dredge">&ldquo;gold dredge&rdquo;</a>, a machine that could process much larger volumes of soil/dirt to extract gold. They went a little crazy with it I think in their efforts to extract the shiny stuff.</p>
<p>Farther on down the valley I bumped into Tim, who was stopping for something to eat. We were both enjoying leftover grilled cheese sandwiches from the dinner on the previous night (an excellent cycling snack). Later on I stopped in the town of Sheridan and had a very tasty calzone at a pizza place called Bread Zeppelin.</p>
<p>At around mile 40 we turned off to the south; at that point although the scenery was still lovely, the ride was a bit more of a slog, since we were dealing with a headwind. I was riding on my own at that point so I put my head down and did my best. Can&rsquo;t recall the mile number, but at a certain point the road came up on a big rock outcropping called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaverhead_Rock">Beaverhead Rock</a>, which had some significance in the Lewis and Clark expedition story.</p>
<p>At that point the shoulder on the road shrank down from a couple feet wide to a really narrow ribbon &ndash; 20 centimeters? It was not great, you really could not ride on it safely, so I mostly rode a ways into the car lane and watched my eyeglass mirror like a hawk for traffic coming up from behind me. Most of the time the cars and trucks overtaking would pull out into the lane and give me space, but there were two or three truck encounters where there was traffic in the oncoming lane, so I had to hold my position (with white knuckles) in the middle of my 20-cm ribbon and then deal with the wind blast when the truck went by me at close range. Not a great cycling experience (other folks felt similarly).</p>
<p>The ride:</p>

<p>Our destination in Dillon MT is a cyclists hostel/camp thing run by a nice older guy Larry; it is a set of outbuildings/cabins where bikers can stay, along with a bunch of grassy areas where folks can pitch tents.</p>

<p>The small shelter where I pitched my tent and left my gear:</p>

<p>My night to cook, so after showering I got in the van with Simona + Mel + Theo and went to the local Safeway, which was a perfectly serviceable grocery store, we had no problems finding what we wanted.</p>
<p>Menu: <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025371-lemon-garlic-linguine">Lemon-Garlic Linguini</a> from the New York times, salad, green beans, pan-fried tofu, and some veggie dumplings as an appetizer.</p>
<p>This was another one of those cooking experiences where everything goes off the rails. I discovered right off the bat that the bottle in the spice bin that I thought was soy sauce was in fact Worcestershire sauce &ndash; whoops. No matter, I moved on. Got everything out, put my water on to heat, prepped my ingredients, started on the salad, got the dumplings into the pan to crisp up (Terrence kindly volunteered to ride herd on them), and at that point clouds started to come in an and before you know it the rain was coming down, bleah.</p>
<p>I ran over and recruited some of my teammates and got one of our portable canopies up and positioned it over the food tables and the stove &hellip; kept cooking. Dumplings were done, so Theo grabbed them and walked them back over to the building where most of the other riders were sheltering.</p>
<p>At that point out of nowhere the wind picked up (it had been completely calm before) and a big gust blew over the canopy &ndash; Terrence and Theo and I wrestled it to the ground and managed to get it folded up, but of course one of the supports (made of aluminum) had bent, phooey. Wind picked up some more and rain started really coming down at that point so I went and got my raincoat and just did my best &ndash; covered up all the things that could be covered and tried to keep the dishes I&rsquo;d started going.</p>
<p>Rain finally ebbed up after about ten minutes, so I was able to resume my cooking and finish the meal, but what I didn&rsquo;t realize is that while I was cooking the strong wind had been blowing rain into my duffel bag and tent. My gear was under a roofed area, but since it wasn&rsquo;t completely enclosed the sideways gusts were getting everything wet. A bunch of my cold-weather stuff and bedding stuff was soaked (thankfully not my sleeping bag, which was sufficiently inside the tent already). Poo.</p>
<p>The dinner was well-received, people enjoyed it from what I can tell, so I was happy about that.  I put out dessert (ice cream), then got started on the cleanup (dishes, getting food and tables put away).   Map meeting interrupted that, and then there was a talk by Larry (the owner/creator of the hostel) &hellip; that dragged on for a while; we finally got back to doing the dishes and cleanup after the talk wound down, at which point I was in a really bad mood and snapped at Simona and Mel for no reason (even though they were there helping me do the work, sigh).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s old Oscar Wilde quote, &ldquo;Man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.&rdquo;, I think that sums up what I was doing at that point. Anyhow, we finally finished all the cleanup and teardown and I was able to get back to organizing my wet gear and relaxing a bit. I am sure in a few days I will have entirely forgotten whatever it was that got me so frustrated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is another challenging ride, this time we have two medium-to-large climbs instead of a single big one. Hope it goes ok&hellip;</p>
