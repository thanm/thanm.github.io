          <p>It was steady rain during the night, continuing through breakfast so we all hustled to get our gear and tents packed up wet, always a tricky business. Thankfully it was not a super cold rain, probably about 60 degrees.</p>
<p>We hit the road around 8 and got onto the trail. Very muddy business!  Shoes and bikes all very liberally coated after a couple of hours. Slight downhill ride following the river; we cycled past Ohiopyle (cute little town, very big with white water kayak/raft folks) and then eventually Connelsville (bit less interesting).</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>There weren&rsquo;t too many opportunites for sight-seeing along the way, but there was an interesting art studio, <a href="https://www.sagermosaics.com/">Sager Mosaics</a>, kind of quirky/funky but with lots of interesting ceramic art to look at (and right on the side of the GAP trail to boot).</p>
<p>At the the Confluence campground, getting ready for our ride in the rain:</p>

<p>Mid-ride, crossing a trestle bridge in the rain:</p>

<p>Muddy bike! Actually this was in pretty good shape compared to some of my compadres, who are riding with no fenders at all (the strap-on rear fender I&rsquo;m running helps a lot):</p>

<p>Sager&rsquo;s Mosaics:</p>

<p>I liked these little ceramic/mosaic cupcake things:</p>

<p>The rain kept going until around 10:30, at which point I took off my jacket, but sure enough it started up again and I had to put it back on. It did finally stop for good an hour after that, but then it also started to cool off, so for the final couple hours of the ride I was going as fast as I could so as to keep warm (the fasty riding did the trick).</p>
<p>The campground in West Newton PA was great &ndash; it had a nice covered common area with a sink and a few other amenities, it was a good place to hang out. We were all pretty cold when we rolled in though; everyone bundled up as soon as we possibly could.</p>
<p>The common area:</p>

<p>Cold night! It was in the mid thirties; I think I would have liked to have a slightly warmer bag, but I did ok.</p>
