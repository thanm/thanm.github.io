          <p>Today was an interesting day in that our group split into two: one gang rode through as usual, and the other group stopped partway to go white-water rafting.</p>
<p>I was kind of on the fence, but eventually decided to skip the rafting &ndash; I am still recovering from my cold (so maybe not great to be dunking myself in 55 degree water), and I needed to spend time working on my bike, which was not going to happen if I went on an excursion.</p>
<p>The ride was around 65 miles, mostly downhill (thankfully), all of it running right along the side of the beautiful Lochsa river. Bit of headwind on the last 20 miles, but in general not a difficult ride.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Lochsa river again, growing bigger and bigger as we move down the valley:</p>

<p>In the early part of the ride we ran into a trailhead leading to a hot springs &ndash; thought briefly about hopping off to explore, but it was still pretty early:</p>

<p>This part of Idaho is the ancestral land of the Nez Perce tribe, so every now and then you see some road and creek names in their language:</p>

<p>A bit farther along the river we saw this set of kayakers navigating the rapids &ndash; it looked really fun, I wish I could have done that:</p>

<p>A shot of the group from our team who did the rafting:</p>

<p>Our destination today was the Three Rivers RV park in Lowell ID, a nice small outfit with friendly people and good tentsites. When I arrived at the park the van and trailer had not yet turned up, but I did get to chat up a couple of other cyclists who had stopped for a snack. One of them was sporting this cool titanium bike, a Carver with a Pinion transmission (there was much oohing and aahing that took place was while the assembled bike nerds looked it over).</p>

<p>After my shower I spent an hour working on my bike, mainly replacing the brake pads, but also cleaning and lubing the drivetrain (a regular task). The material on the pads was not completely worn away, but I&rsquo;d been noticing that the pull was a bit soft when I applied them, so better to take care of them now and avoid any trouble later on down the line in Oregon.</p>
<p>Dan and Mike cooking tonight, spaghetti for mains and guacamole + chips for appetizer&hellip; should be good .</p>
<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s ride looks like it will be a bit more work, a nice substantial climb around mile 30 &hellip;</p>
