          <p>Super long cycling day today, 87 miles up to Ennis Montana. It had the potential to be a fearsome ride, but the wind gods were kind to us and we had a slight tailwind the whole way north, which made it a much easier ride (it was also mostly a slight downhill).</p>
<p>A cold start in the Madison campground in Yellowstone; after getting out on the road I wound up zooming ahead of the pack just so that I could get warm by riding faster. I caught up to Tim, rode with him for about 20 miles or so, then he left me behind when I went off to investigate a roadside store.</p>
<p>The route took us due west out of the national park; at the entrance we got to see the huge lines starting to form for people trying to get in. In the town of West Yellowstone we turned north, then in about 10 miles went left onto route 287, which we followed the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Route 287 winds up into the mountains a bit into a huge steep valley containing a pair of lakes, one of which is called Earthquake lake after a very powerful quake (Richter 7.5) that took place in 1959, and generated a landslide that substantially reshaped the valley. The signage on that was interesting, and they now haver a visitor&rsquo;s center devoted to the quake at the north end of the valley on top of the spot where the landslide was the most severe.</p>
<p>From there the road emerges from the mountains and comes down into the Madison river valley, a huge expanse of a valley with snow-capped mountains running on either side &ndash; very beautiful.</p>
<p>Got rained on from around mile 25 to mile 60, light stuff, nothing serious, but it did require rain gear. Around mile 55 I stopped in Cameron MT (microscopic, doesn&rsquo;t even deserve to be called a town) and had fun chatting up another trans-AM group, bunch of Brits doing a West-to-East run.</p>
<p>The riding for most of the way was great &ndash; slight downhill and slight tailwind, so super zoomy. Around 5 hours in the saddle, average speed of 17 mph. I stopped in our destination town (Ennis MT) and had a nice Cubano sandwich for second lunch around 1:45, that was a treat.</p>

<p>Campground is an RV park, which I am actually looking forward to after the Yellowstone place &ndash; it is good to have things like electrical power, hot showers, WiFi, and so on.  We had another minor wrinkle with the weather &ndash; a little after we arrived it raining again, this time a bit harder, so everyone hustled to pitch their tents.</p>
<p>New state &hellip; Montana! After this it&rsquo;s just Idaho and Oregon, we are ticking them off one by one.</p>

<p>The saloon in Cameron (closed of course) where I bumped into the British trans-am group:</p>

<p>This shot is maybe 15 miles from Ennis, looking east towards the wall of mountains at the border of the valley. Very lovely&hellip;</p>

<p>When I reached Ennis I stopped for a sandwich at Kalena&rsquo;s and had a Cubano for my second lunch &hellip; very tasty (I am picky about my Cubanos, so it was good to get one that ticked all the boxes).</p>

<p>Terrence and Mike cooking tonight, we&rsquo;ll see what they come up with. Theo and I are &ldquo;on deck&rdquo;, we get to prepare dinner tomorrow night after another big climbing day.</p>
<p>Feels good to be back a tiny bit closer to civilization, I have to say that it is nice to have my cell phone working (mostly) again.</p>
