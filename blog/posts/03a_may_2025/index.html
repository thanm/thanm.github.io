<p>Bummed that we will not have him around, I enjoyed his sense of humor and his perspective as a seasoned California rider.

<p>[NB: we heard much later in the tour from Simona that Scott turned out to have a bunch of serious undiagnosed problems with the veins/arteries in his legs, which was what was causing the issues once the really steep climbing began. His doctors were apparently flabbergasted that he had been able to make it as far as he did on the tour, which I think speaks to his level of commitment and effort up until we hit Ohio. Still sorry that things didn&rsquo;t work out for him.]</p>
