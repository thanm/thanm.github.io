Ride:


We had  very early start, since we we were staying at a hostel &ndash; no need to take time setting up camp kitchen or taking down tents, etc. At breakfast we all chatted with Dana one of the hostel caretakers; turns out she is a long distance hiker and had all sorts of stores about the PCT, the AZT, and the long trail." />

<p>We had  very early start, since we we were staying at a hostel &ndash; no need to take time setting up camp kitchen or taking down tents, etc. At breakfast we all chatted with Dana one of the hostel caretakers; turns out she is a long distance hiker and had all sorts of stores about the PCT, the AZT, and the long trail.</p>
<p>Not too many photos today, I was just focused on getting the ride done and in the books. Also there wasn&rsquo;t really much to see on the ride, not a lot of interesting stopping places. This was a ride to get from point A to point B, not to be admiring the stuff in between.</p>
<p>Partway up the climb I looked over to the side of the road and saw a cordless drill of all things perched on the guardrail &ndash; this has Tim&rsquo;s fingerprints all over it of course. He likes to look for odd &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that people have discarded on the side of the road (or in this case, fell off someone&rsquo;s truck) &hellip; if the items are small enough he packs them along, otherwise he cues them up for us to admire:</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the pass:</p>

<p>I caught up with Mike partway through the the big downhill, and we stopped in Prineville together for a bite at this place:</p>

<p>The campground here in Prineville &ndash; it is at an RV park attached to a county fairground; they indicated we could pitch our tents on this grassy bit:</p>

<p>Management also put up this friendly sign welcoming cyclists, but their choice of where to spot it was not great (kind of bidding us welcome to the dump station):</p>

<p>Chet and Mike are cooking tonight.  I suspect it will be something basic; imaginative ideas on new things to cook are a bit in short supply..</p>
