          <p>A medium distance ride, 59 miles, 2065 elevation gain, but a good deal more challenging than I had expected; we had gusty head/side winds and it rained intermittently, so we had to dress carefully to avoid getting cold, and there was a fair amount of work involved. Road shoulder was a good size and surface was ok, but lots of traffic with trucks&ndash; grain trucks (we saw a ton of those) and a whole procession of &ldquo;oversized load&rdquo; trucks for some reason.</p>

<p>We also had some more terrain changes &ndash; about five miles out of Sterling suddenly we were back in agricultural flatland again, and that continued for a while, then it sort of switched back and forth for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>Nice food stop at a cafe in New Raymer; it seemed to be reasonably busy in spite of not being on our radar at all. I had a tasty chicken sandwich to supplement my packed lunch.</p>
<p>A coupla selfies on the road, one with Chet and one with Mike; rainy weather was not going to dampen our spirits:</p>

<p>The rain was interesting in that we could see the rain clouds from a long way off and watch them sweep in, so you could anticipate when you were going to get dumped on:</p>

<p>We were originally supposed to be camping in Briggsdale, but our awesome tour leader Arlen was able to arrange for us to stay in the gym at the local high school, super glad about that. Pic of the enormous and gleaming gym where we set up our tents:</p>

<p>Back still super sore, I have been hobbling around a lot. I broke down and took a couple of ibuprofen this morning, but (as is usually the case) it didn&rsquo;t seem to help much. Hopefully I can rest it up in Fort Collins on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Arlen and Chet cooking tonight.</p>
<p>Looking forward to our upcoming zero day in Fort Collins; I have some shopping to do and some packages to pick up (one from Amy, one from Zpacks).</p>
