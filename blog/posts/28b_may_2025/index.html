<p>Most of my major gear items still going strong (especially my bike), but in the last few weeks my sleeping pad seems to have developed a slow leak &hellip; I get it all inflated, go to sleep, and in about four hours it has lost most of its oomph.  I am planning on replacing it when we get to Fort Collins, looking forward to that. It was about a five year old pad, so not too much of a surprise that it gave out.</p>
<p>I also managed to lose one of my earbuds (oops) and mangled one of the buckles on my tent by stepping on it &hellip; those are fairly easily solved problems however, and not really due to &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; per se.</p>
<p>It is interesting to think about that fact that we&rsquo;re all using our camping gear so intensively &ndash; most people might use their tents and sleeping bags and such for maybe two, three weeks a year total at most (once you add it all up), whereas we&rsquo;re doing almost four to to five times that much on this jaunt. Adding to that, we pack up + move + unpack our stuff every day, which I think adds even more stress to the mix.</p>
<p>As of today I still have not had any flat tires (hopefully I haven&rsquo;t just jinxed myself by writing this), pretty amazing when you get right down to it. Some of my fellow riders have had a half dozen flats already at this point. Simona actually had simultaneous flats on both wheels during the ride today due to the evil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthospermum_hispidum">goat&rsquo;s head thorns</a>.</p>
