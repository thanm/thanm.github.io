          <p>A 58 mile ride today with one big climb (Lolo Pass), so reasonably challenging but certainly not a ride that knocked our socks off.</p>
<p>Starting in Missoula we rode south following Route 12, then turned west into the mountains still following 12. It was a steady low-grade uphill until around mile 40, then a reasonably steep (5% maybe) climb up to the summit of the pass.</p>

<p>I managed the climb ok, but I think I am still feeling aftereffects from my cold, since I felt kind of blah and didn&rsquo;t have all of usual climbing energy.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Photos at Lolo pass. As of this pass crossing we have a new state, Idaho (yay!) and we are switching to the Pacific time zone.  We also crossed the 3000 mile mark on our ride today, so we have many milestones to celebrate, huzzah!</p>

<p>The visitor&rsquo;s center. Although the center itself was closed (?), here we encountered a ranger who told us about an active fire that was burning farther down theroad (40ish miles) and gave us instructions on how to ride past it (basically: no rubbernecking).</p>

<p>Prairie dogs watching us carefully, wondering if we were about to drop some sort of tasty tidbit on the ground:</p>

<p>The road we were on follows next to the Lochsa river, another very lovely stream; it got bigger and deeper as we rode along.</p>

<p>On the way we stopped at the DeVoto memorial grove, a section of very old red cedars and a small set of paths in and among them. The signage said that these sort of red cedar can live for a long time, more than a thousand years (!); the trees in this area were huge.</p>

<p>While on the path I encountered a grouse, a very weird grouse, since it essentially jumped out onto the trail and flapped around making noise at me. I finally figured out that it was a mama grouse who had a nest with babies nearby (I eventually heard a couple of them), and the flapping and noise-making was a distraction designed to lead me away from the kids. The big display made it extra easy to photograph her, though, so I got some good shots.</p>

<p>Our campground is at Powell Junction, not really a town per se &ndash; it has a gas station amd some sort of a very modest lodge/resort (we were able to take showers there) and then a USFS campground, where our group stayed, but that&rsquo;s about it. Nice and quiet, no electricity, few other folks visiting, zero cell coverage. In fact we&rsquo;re going to be out of cell range for a while on this stretch in Idaho.</p>
<p>Terry and I cooked dinner; we did an improvised fish curry with rice and salad &ndash; it turned out well and seemed to be positively received, so I was happy with that. I had originally wanted to make my favorite chicken curry (which comes from the Gourmet &ldquo;Green&rdquo; book, and uses ground up cashews for thickening), and in fact Amy thoughtfully sent me the recipe and a small packet of cashews, but I Terry and I finally opted for fish instead, since it meant that we could have a single dish instead of doing a meatful version and a veggie/pescatarian version.</p>
<p>One of the key limitations on our camp kitchen is the number of pots &ndash; we have two big ones and one small one, so it can be pretty trick to do multiple versions of things like soups and stews.</p>
<p>At of this point in the tour we now have 14 riding days left &ndash; basically a week riding in Idaho and a week riding in Oregon.  I am starting to feel some anticipation for the end of this journey &ndash; I love the rides and hugely enjoy spending time with the people, but all the other aspects of our routine (pitching of tents, cooking and cleaning in a camp kitchen, dealing with campground bathrooms and campground noises) are things that I&rsquo;m starting to get pretty tired of.</p>
