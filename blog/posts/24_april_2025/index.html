          <p>One last day on the C&amp;O Canal Towpath trail.</p>
<p>After all of the chaos and mayhem caused by downed trees from the previous ride, our leaders decided that it would be a good idea to bypass the first few miles of the trail, just to get well and truly away from the tornado damage. So we piled all of the bikes on top of the van, packed all the riders into the inside, and set off to drive to a spot that looked good. With all the packing and organizing this took a while.</p>
<p>Once we finally got started (around 10am) the ride was great &ndash; warm weather, clear, and as usual a mix of riding surfaces, some nice and smooth and others nasty and rocky.  Ride below (the first super-straight stuff is GPS artifact, software making sense of being turned off in one spot and turned back on after a drive):</p>

<p>We went through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw_Paw_Tunnel">Paw Paw tunnel</a> today, definitely and interesting bit of C&amp;O history. You can read all the gory details on the web, but it was a huge effort to construct it back in the day (almost &ldquo;Big Dig&rdquo; like). Photo of the entrance:</p>

<p>Very dark and wet, flashlight most definitely needed. Apparently the lining required 6 million bricks, a remarkable number. On the way through:</p>

<p>I was riding with Mike, who is a strong cyclist, and we eventually joined up with Tim, another strong cyclist, and after a certain point we were really flying along, 16 or 17 mph over gravel (I was having to work reasonably hard to keep up). Arrived well ahead of schedule, so we decided to celebrate with a beer at a local pub, that was nice.</p>

<p>We eventually arrived at the Cumberland MD YMCA, a rather nice big Y that had a large grassy playaround across the street from it; turns out that for this Y you can camp as long as you agree to delay pitching your tent until 6pm.</p>
<p>Some extra tie, so it was good to get my tent and sleeping bag well aired out (they needed it).</p>
<p>Superb dinner (fish tacos) cooked by our team-made Mel; definitely a cut above your usual camping meal.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: goodbye C&amp;O, hello GAP (Great Allegheny Passage) trail, so no more flat stuff, we get to do at least a little bit of climbing for a change.</p>
