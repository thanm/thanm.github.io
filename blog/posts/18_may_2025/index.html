          <p>Long ride today, 75 miles with lots of elevation (4175ft). It was better than it could have been though, since we were heading mostly west and north, and in the westbound segments we had a decent tailwind &ndash; made a huge difference.  Finished in about 5 hours riding time.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning, so not a lot in the way of open cafes and restaurants, and in fact we had a hard time finding anything that was open (in the smaller towns there were gas stations but just basically pumps, no store).</p>

<p>Post office in Whiting, KS. This microscopic town had the only open store and bathroom we found on the ride:</p>

<p>Interesting old building in Goff, KS. Why the chicken? No idea.</p>

<p>I rode with a gang of six (myself, Chet, Mel, Tom, Terrence, and Mike), then for the last 15 miles Mike and I powered ahead.</p>

<p>We are staying at a small private RV park, &ldquo;Baileys&rdquo;, which tacked onto the side of a golf course not too far from the shops and such in town. Nice place, good wifi, super windy (as with all the other places we&rsquo;ve visited in Kansas). Actual decent bathrooms for a change, yay.</p>
<p>Photo of Bailey&rsquo;s tent area:</p>

<p>Scary weather forecast for tonight and tomorrow, severe thunderstorms with major amounts of rain (1+ inches).</p>
<p>[Update, posted later in the day] Well, I chickened out on the tent camping tonight, or to put it differently I had a moment of weakness and gave in to temptation and rented a room at a motel adjacent to the RV park (one minute walk). The weather looked sufficiently unpleasant that I thought it would be worth it.</p>
