          <p>Medium ride today of 56 miles, 1000 feet of elevation gain. Nothing too challenging, mostly downhill with a few mild headwinds. Warm weather for our rides now &ndash; it was 62 when we started out, and by the time we rolled into Coburg it was 87 (felt like more in the full sun). Too warm for me &hellip; I definitely miss the nice cool &ldquo;high of 45 degrees&rdquo; days back in April.</p>
<p>Not too much in the way of interesting scenery, so no photos to speak of &ndash; I was mainly focused on moving along and arriving early enough to beat the heat and to have time to do laundry and shop for groceries (I seem to be cooking dinner again).</p>
<p>This route tracks the McKenzie river, which starts out a bit on the small side and is quite enormous by the time it goes past Coburg.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>On the plus side the RV park we are staying at has electricity, good showers, and decent WiFi (as long as you are close to the office building) &hellip; I can get caught up on my email and blogging.</p>
<p>For dinner I cooked with Simona; she made a pan of frozen veggies, and I did sauteed tofu and a stir fry with pork tenderloin, with a big pot of rice to go with. Seemed to be well received.</p>
<p>Two more rides to go, we&rsquo;re getting down to the dregs&hellip;</p>
