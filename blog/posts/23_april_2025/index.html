          <p>Long cycling day today, 77 miles &ndash; on gravel no less (eek).</p>
<p>Our guides got up early and had our breakfast ready a bit earlier than the normal 7am, that was good. We headed out on our way.  Today I rode a bit with Deb, we chatted about various things and enjoyed the scenery, then eventually I detached and headed on my own for a good stretch.</p>
<p>Lots of time to observe the Potomac, which is quite a river.  I have seldom seen a river of that size that has so many rocky bits in it &ndash; it seemed as though every time I looked over at it there were collections of jagged rocks sticking just out of the river, with plenty more below to make trouble for boats (I guess the rockiness is probably one of the big reasons they put in the canal).</p>
<p>There are also some 1830/1840&rsquo;s era masonry dams at various places, that was interesting to see. River very wiggly, it seemed like the path was zooming around all of the place.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Photos:</p>
<p>A couple of us stopped at the town of Harper&rsquo;s Ferry and poked around there (this was the site of many important things during the civil war era). Here&rsquo;s the armory house where John Brown made his final stand:</p>

<p>Harper&rsquo;s Ferry is also where the Appalachian Trail crosses over the C&amp;O, so that was kind of cool:</p>

<p>This guy was actually riding the C&amp;O with his dog (in a trailer):</p>

<p>I made it all the way to the town of Hancock MD without any real mishaps, and had a nice dish of chocolate ice cream at a trailside restaurant by the name of &ldquo;Buddy Lou&rsquo;s&rdquo;. From there, was a straight 7 mile shot to the campground along the Western Maryland bike trail (which parallels the C&amp;O). What could be easier?</p>
<p>Well, that was where the wheels started to come off unfortunately for our gang (the cycling gods were not kind to us I am afraid). Almost immediately coming out of Hancock we started hitting downed trees across the trail &ndash; big ones, and a lot of them. We had to lift our bikes over them, and some were even too big for that (had to detour around into the woods). Representative tree obstacle:</p>

<p>Super surprising to see downed trees this time of year, since most of them were just starting to leaf out. Even stranger the trees that were down looked pretty solid and healthy (???).</p>
<p>I was riding on my own at that point and finally made it through to the turnoff. Uphill ride to the campground, then hunted around until I finally found the ACA trailer and van.</p>
<p>Next wonky bit: the campground had no power, and as a result no running water either (eek). So no showers, and a very jury-rigged toilet system that required a lengthy walk (bummer). It turned out that there had been tornados in the area just a couple of days before: this is what knocked down all the trees and what knocked out the power to the camp. No WiFi (due to lack of power), and to top it off the area reserved for tent camping was not great &ndash; very hilly, not a lot of good level places to pitch tents (waaat?). We made do, I think most folks got a decent tent-worthy spot.</p>
<p>We sat around and chatted and tried to keep our spirits up &hellip; stiff upper lip and all. About an hour after that however we got word that one of our tour-mates had fallen on the trail. Nothing life-threatening, but cut up and bruised pretty bad. He&rsquo;d been riding in a section with the tree debris and a stick got lodged in between his front fender and front wheel; this locked the wheel up almost instantly and sent him over the handlbars and onto the pavement head-first.</p>
<p>Our guides sprang into action and bundled our injured teammate off to the hospital in the van &hellip; but of course that left us without any food for dinner (the van had been just about to head to the grocery store to buy provisions).</p>
<p>It was a late night &ndash; once the medical care was settled and underway our guides came back with some food, so we finally had some dinner and eventually settled in for the night (without showering however, ugh).</p>
<p>So maybe not the best day ever, especially for our injured rider, but I was impressed with how well our guides dealt with the various problems (most importantly being the well-being of our riders of course).</p>
