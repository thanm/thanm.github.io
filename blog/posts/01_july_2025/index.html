          <p>Another medium ride today, 53 miles, 1500 feet of elevation gain, 4 hours 10 minute in the saddle. Flat with mild headwinds for the first 30 miles, then a really steep 1000 foot climb in the mountains, then a bit of up and down for the remainder.</p>
<p>I rode with Tom and Terence today (no Chet, he is no longer around). We stopped and had a nice cup of coffee in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>We had some mayhem with the route this time, turns out that the last seven miles of the ride map were incorrect, it was directing us into a dirt road, then a logging road, then a rough thing that petered out altogether. Our lead rider (as always Tim) got a fair ways into it, then eventually messaged our leaders, who advised him to turn around and come back (there was an alternate route that was also around 7 miles that was actually on pavement). By the time I got to the problematic intersection with Tom and Terence things had been all sorted out, so no harm done in our case.</p>
<p>Turns out that the same problem happened last year, was reported by that previous crew, but then somehow the map never got updated (this somehow does not seem surprising based on my experience so far).</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Poor Tim also had problems at the start of his ride; he had turned onto Pearl street in Coburg (only about a mile from the RV park) and was traveling west with the sun behind him. A car approached Pearl perpendicularly on a side street on Tim&rsquo;s right, then made a left turn in but didn&rsquo;t see Tim at all due to the sun. Would have been ok under normal circumstances but since the driver didn&rsquo;t see Tim he &ldquo;cut the corner&rdquo; on the turn and that forced Tim onto the curb and then eventually onto the pavement. More bruises and cuts for Tim, but luckily this time a lot less severe than when the crazy lady made a run at us in Baker City. The driver stopped and was very apologetic, so that was good (there was clearly no ill intent involved).</p>
<p>Pretty warm, mid eighties, but maybe just a hair cooler than yesterday (mid-90s) so I was happy about that.</p>
<p>At one point four or five miles from the climb I was cycling along with Tom and we came up on a house that had a big cherry tree growing in the front yard, with branches extending out into the road shoulder. Entire tree was loaded with cherries, absolutely ripe, dark as sin, just hanging there looking delicious.  I told myself it was not my tree and I should not be taking any, but my willpower caved and I had to try a few (they were fantastic). Tom averted his gaze so as not to be led into temptation :-).</p>

<p>Coming into Alsea we saw this sign, which immediately brought back thoughts of our Wyoming teammate Deb who left the tour back in Lander.  Hope she is doing well.</p>

<p>The campground. In spite of being a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; USFS campground (as far as I know) it actually had pretty decent showers (50 cents for a minute), so we were all super happy about that. There are some nice trees for shade, and the tent sites are level and in good condition.</p>

<p>This place actually had a yurt you could reserve as well &ndash; we poked around the outside of it and peeked in the windows (nobody using it), looked pretty cushy:</p>

<p>The Strawberry river flows by just a stone&rsquo;s throw from our camp; I went down to investigate the swimming possibilities but eventually decided against (water was kind of slow moving and didn&rsquo;t look like it would come up any higher than my shins).</p>
<p>Dan and Terry cooking tonight, this will be our last camp-cooked supper.</p>
