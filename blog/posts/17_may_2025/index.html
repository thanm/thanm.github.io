<p>Today&rsquo;s agenda included a bike ride into town (3 or 4 miles) and a session at the laundromat for an extended laundry session, a pizza lunch, and a side trip to the Amelia Earhart home museum.</p>
<p>In fact there are lots of markers and statues and such devoted to Amelia Earhart, it&rsquo;s clear she is a big part of the town. A statue:</p>

<p>First swim on this tour! This was in the pond not far from our camping area in Atchison. Nice cool water. A bit hard to get in and out on the dock, but worth it. I waited until mid-afternoon for maximum warmth.</p>

<p>All in all a good rest day.  Looking forward to dinner; Tom and Simona are planning on doing a &ldquo;breakfast for dinner&rdquo; meal (pancakes maybe? we&rsquo;ll see).</p>
