          <p>Another medium ride today, 51 miles, but with a minimum of climbing, 1795 feet elevation gain, 3 hours 41 minutes riding time. It was good to take it easy again.</p>
<p>I had a hard time getting to sleep the night before, there was to much loud traffic from the rodeo (basically people gunning their very large truck engines), it was a while until I fell asleep, and I was a bit late getting up (5:45am).</p>
<p>For the ride it was a slight downhill out of Prineville, no wind, easy spinning. The path followed a big rocky outcrop, winds around in the valley and eventually dumps out into a river valley. Then a climb up into a nice alpine plateau with really amazing views of the Sisters (mountains) off to the west &ndash; very beautiful.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>I rode with Chet, Tom, and Terence today, it was fun to hang with them and chat on the ride.</p>
<p>Stopped for coffee at Red Point in Terrebonne, they had really good coffee and a nice space for hanging out. Red Point sells rock climbing gear, then doubles as a coffee shop, then triples as a brewpub (bunch of local beers on tap). Seems like they have all the bases covered&hellip;</p>
<p>Later we dropped in on the store at Rainshadow Organics (a local greens farm) for snacks and water, they were perfectly positioned for us to refill.</p>
<p>Finally I had one more stop in Sisters as well; nice meal of tacos at a food truck on the main drag.</p>
<p>A few photos &hellip;</p>

<p>The Cold Spring campground a bit beyond Sisters:</p>

<p>Drinks in Sisters at the Barn, after the ride:</p>

<p>Our campsite is the Cold Spring UFSF CG, it is super basic, which is fine by me &ndash; hopefully it will be nice and quiet tonight.</p>
<p>Simona and Dan helpfully volunteered to drive us into the main part of town to shower (at the city park). Not the cleanest shower I&rsquo;ve ever been in, but it did the job&hellip;</p>
<p>Dinner at a restaurant (TBD) in Sisters a bit later.</p>
