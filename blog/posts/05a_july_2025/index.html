          <p>[A warning for readers, this post probably isn&rsquo;t interesting to regular humans, but if you help run bike tours or you&rsquo;ve been on an ACA tour before I think you might possibly be interested&hellip;]</p>
<p>Since finishing the tour I have been thinking and reflecting a bit more about the daily routines that we had on the road and how he impacted our overall experience.  Sounds a bit pedestrian, but the things you do every day (other than riding) have an outsized impact on what it&rsquo;s like to do one of these trips.</p>
<p>One of my teammates described the ACA tour experience as a bit like the movie &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)">Ground Hog Day</a>&rdquo;, in which the main character is stuck in a science-fictiony time loop, and has to repeat the same day over and over again. There are definitely times when this style of bike touring has a time-loopy repetitive quality.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ground Hog Day&rdquo; feeling is not about the rides &ndash; each day on the bike you see different territory + terrain, different towns and states, and so on.</p>
<p>The repetitiveness instead comes from all the other required rituals each day: pitching and/or taking down and packing up your tent, getting out your sleeping bag and other stuff (headlamp, hat, long underwear, dry bags), getting your clothes and gear organized and packed or unpacked, getting the camp kitchen set up, doing the food layout and food prep and kitchen cleanup, and so on.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a lot of room for improvization with all these steps, and you very definitely can&rsquo;t skip any of them (if you fail to pack a lunch, you will not be happy out on the bike without anything to eat). You also can&rsquo;t really dawdle or take your time when it comes to your morning task list &ndash; you need to be done with everything and out on your bike early so as to take advantage of the nice weather (and allow enough time for all the things you do in the afternoon!).</p>
<p>Short of switching from camping to staying in motels or B&amp;Bs I&rsquo;m not sure there is an easy way to eliminate the day to day camp routine toil, and in fact many of the campgrounds are quite nice places to visit and to stay.</p>
<p>Another set of aspects of the tour that I spent time pondering were the information path from the leaders to the riders (e.g. &ldquo;map meeting&rdquo;) and then the corresponding feedback path from the riders to the leaders (about how things went on the ride).</p>
<p>To explain: one of the things we do at some point before each ride (usually the night before) is to have a &ldquo;map meeting&rdquo; to discuss it. The map meeting mainly is a way of making sure that we have a good grip on the mundane but important details of the ride &ndash; total mileage and elevation gain, the place we&rsquo;ll be staying at the other end, the points along the way were we can get water or food, and so on.</p>
<p>The tour leaders also read out items from the &ldquo;leader notes&rdquo; (essentially a shared online document on the tour) to highlight interesting things or important services you&rsquo;ll encounter at particular mile markers (&ldquo;Mile 42 has a visitor&rsquo;s center with an interesting museum&rdquo;, etc).</p>
<p>Although the meetings are helpful, the actual mechanics are pretty comical. You have a tour leader essentially reading out bits of info verbally from their cell phone (&ldquo;The address for the RV park is 1234 Smith Street&rdquo;) and you have the collected riders each thumb-typing the same info into their phones&hellip;. this is really pretty dumb when you think about it. It would work a whole lot better (fewer typos, less wasted time, etc) if the leaders could simply compose an email or chat message and send it at some point earlier that day.</p>
<p>The second problem is that there wasn&rsquo;t (as far as I could tell) a frictionless mechanism for correcting/improving the information in the leader notes.</p>
<p>Specifically, the material in the leader notes isn&rsquo;t always accurate &ndash; sometimes the spots mentioned are permanently closed or have moved. There are also new things that people discover along the way: a just-opened store or cafe, or a newly discovered city park with a bathroom, etc.  These new discoveries nearly always seem to get dropped on the floor as far as I can tell &ndash; riders don&rsquo;t have any easy way to report them, and and both riders and leaders are too busy doing other stuff (pitching tents etc) to remember to type them into the computer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my take, I am sure there is more I could say about routines + processes but this is what stood out to me.</p>
