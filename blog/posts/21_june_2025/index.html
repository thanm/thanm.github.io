          <p>Lots of rain last night, after it started around dinner time I think it didn&rsquo;t let up for several hours, then went on intermittently for the rest of the night. Mel told me he went out around 11 to use the bathroom and it was snowing?</p>
<p>Thankfully my tent came through ok, no wet gear for me (combination of good tent and carefully picked tent spot). Mike was not so lucky, he had lots of water in his tent and quite a lot of his gear was soaked (judging from my informal survey there were a few others who also had some water in their tents).</p>
<p>Cool (42 maybe?) weather but not raining (whew) &hellip; we did the usual morning routine and I packed some rain gear just in case.</p>
<p>Photo taken at the start of the ride (just before breakfast) of the hillside opposite the Pinehurst RV park, pine trees in the fog:</p>

<p>The ride today was a total of 67 miles with plenty of climbing (3000ft), but due to the rescramble yesterday it was a lot easier than the monster 80 miles + 4000ft thing that was originally supposed to happen.</p>
<p>First ten miles was great, steady climb of around 2000 feet &ndash; I had all my normal climbing energy for a change (yay) and made quick progress. The road then emptied us out into a beautiful, flat, high plain for another ten miles or so. Around mile 22 we stopped in New Meadows at a coffee place (Tim, Chet, Mike, and myself), very congenial.</p>
<p>The section of the ride after that was a good bit more difficult, we turned to the east and headed up into the mountains, at which point it began to rain, then snow (the white stuff only lasted a few minutes, but it was still good and cold after that). Got all my gear on (except the rain pants, which I had opted to leave behind) and soldiered on&hellip; I was freezing by the time we made it to the next town (Council ID) at around mile 45. Chet and I stopped and had lunch at a pizza place and got warmed up, I was very happy to take a break at that point.</p>
<p>The section from Council down to Cambridge was warmer (thank goodness) but also had pretty heavy traffic and sections where the shoulder was small or nonexistent, so we had to ride really carefully. Not too many photos on this ride.</p>
<p>Finally rolled into the Mundo Hot Springs Resort outside Cambridge Idaho around 1:30, so made pretty good time. The hot springs place looks great, basically an RV park with a hot-springs-fed pool; after getting our tents set up and taking showers we had a really enjoyable soak in the hot pool (around 104F or so).</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Partway through the ride to Cambridge ID:</p>

<p>When we arrived everyone had a lot of wet gear to dry out. Mike in particular, just about all his stuff was wet. A shot of all his gear drying (looks like his duffle bag exploded, showering stuff all over the grass):</p>

<p>A few shots from our visit to the hot springs pool at Mundo &ndash; this thing was great (too bad every RV park doesn&rsquo;t have one):</p>

<p>Tim and Mike cooked dinner; they went with macaroni salad and chili dogs (all American menu). Tasty stuff. The cooking process was interrupted by a couple of brief but fierce rain showers; luckily we had one of the canopies up to protect the kitchen and this time we were able to get it sufficiently tied down in time that it didn&rsquo;t blow away.</p>
<p>Shorter ride tomorrow, and to our first town in Oregon &ndash; looking forward to ticking off that last new state.</p>
