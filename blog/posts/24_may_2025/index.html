          <p>No mileage today, we are relaxing here in McCook, Nebraska in a motel. It is a pleasure to sleep in a bed and have regular meals cooked by someone else &hellip;</p>
<p>This morning a group of wandered down to the center of town and saw the sights: a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and a couple of museums, including The Museum of the High Plains, and a newer spot called the Art Bank.</p>
<p>A few photos:</p>
<p>Main street in McCook, the older part of town:</p>

<p>The Frank Lloyd Wright house here in town:</p>

<p>Plaque outlining the life and works of George Norris, an important historical figure for Nebraska:</p>

<p>Warm memorial statue in the city park. Nearly all of the towns we&rsquo;ve passed through have warm memorials, even the smaller ones.</p>

<p>The Museum of the Plains was interesting, also very hodge-podge (no organizational scheme that I could determine whatsoever).</p>
<p>The nice lady running the show there got our her keys and let us into the railway caboose they have parked at the museum; we clambered around inside and got to see it up close. Not a very luxurious interior, it was mainly bunks where the train crew could get a bit of shut-eye from time to time.</p>

<p>Couple of pictures from the Art Bank. They had an exhibition in which an artist did a series of paintings about the massacre at Wounded Knee, which was quite something (very dark).</p>

<p>Dinner tonight at a slightly tonier restaurant that Chet picked out, looking forward to that.</p>
<p>From the forecast it looks like we will get rained on during our ride tomorrow, not giant amounts but we&rsquo;ll need to gear up. Winds still favorable, 10-15 mph east-north-east, so that will be a blessing if the prediction holds.</p>
