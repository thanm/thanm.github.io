I&rsquo;ll miss him, sorry that he won&rsquo;t be able to round out the tour and do the wheel dip. He was one of my favorite people to ride with, and I enjoyed his sense of humor and wisecracks (delivered daily in his gravely voice).  I guess I will have to drink the remainder of the chocolate milk in the cooler now &hellip;" />
