	<meta name="description" content="Zero day in Mount Sterling Ohio.
Weather forecast: rain all day, but heck, it was an off day, no need to ride in the wet stuff, and we had the van to drive us places if we needed to go somewhere.
The group opted to get in the van and travel into Columbus to explore the city en masse, so that was fun.
We visited the REI store, I bought a few more rain-related items (waterproof socks, we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, and some medium-sized dry bags). The it was off to the Columbus Museum of Art, which was pretty decent (they had a nice exhibition on the artist Louise Nevelson)." />
