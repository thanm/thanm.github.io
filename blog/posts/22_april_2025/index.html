          <p>Our first real riding day, woohoo! Much excitement for getting started with the real stuff. Of course to get to the real stuff we had to cycle from the Crystal City part of DC up to the start of the towpath which is not far from the Watergate complex.  That was actually more work than I had thought it would be, the small group I was in got lost (trying to follow signs for a detour) but eventually got back on track.</p>
<p>The towpath was interesting: first 10 miles or so packed with commuters coming the other way (all of them with &ldquo;game face&rdquo; expressions and riding very fast), then things settled down a bit after that. The road surface varied tremendously, raging from very rough rocks and gravel to lovely silky smooth rock dust (some sections were a good deal less bumpy than the street I live on in Arlington).</p>
<p>The trees at this stage in the spring were still leafing out &ndash; lots of little baby leaves, pale green color, still reaching for the light and expanding out into their full size. Super active birdlife, there were all sorts of things to see in that department. Lots of animals as well, including woodchucks and deer. A total of 60 miles, good weather, not too hot. There were things to see along the way, primarily the Great Falls section of the river, but since I had seen it before on previous rides I decided to move on ahead and skip that.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>A representative lock on the path. They range from completely nonexistent (someone got rid of all the wood and left the stonework) to almost functional (I think there might even be one or two that do still work). This one is somewhere in between:</p>

<p>Lunch! In this case a hummus sandwich with spinach. Not going to win any Michelin awards but tasty enough.</p>

<p>We eventually pulled into our camground in the town of Brunswick, pretty small and boasting a large and extremely active rail yard (more on that later).  Our guides cooked the first dinner meal for us (pasta with chicken, chickpeas on the side) and I think everyone enjoyed it. In theory we were all supposed to be watching closely to the various routines for using the camp kitchen equipment, so I tried to follow along.</p>
<p>The black flies at this site were pretty fierce, I got a pretty good collection of bites while trying to get my tent pitched (after that I ran off to the shower and changed into some slightly more bug-resistant clothing).</p>
<p>Tent in good working order (my trusty and battle-tested ZPacks Duplex, which I&rsquo;ve taken on all sorts of backpacking trips), and sleeping bag as well. So far so good on the gear (and most importantly no more &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; from the bike).</p>
<p>Got a good night&rsquo;s sleep in spite of noises all night from the rail yard (mainly big engines hauling cars back and forth). Something would wake me uop occasionally but I just went back to sleep when that happened.</p>
<p>All in all a good start.</p>
<p>[Note: kind of backed up on the blog posts! There have been several days without workable WIFI so I probably won&rsquo;t get completely caught up until our zero day in Pittsburgh.]</p>
