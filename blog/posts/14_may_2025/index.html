          <p>Back to riding on pavement! Super zoomy ride today, we had a huge tailwind, which was lovely &ndash; getting wafted along as if you were riding an e-bike or something. The route itself was nice too, very slow rolling hills and lots of wide open spaces.</p>
<p>Selfie on the road:</p>

<p>The road in the background is pretty representative of what we had to work with today &ndash; surface ok, but with a nasty loose gravel shoulder, you definitely want to stay off that unless it is an absolute emergency.</p>
<p>We passed Arrow Rock, a spot where the Santa Fe trail intersects with the Lewis + Clark route, but there was not much to see there since the visitor&rsquo;s center was closed.</p>

<p>We stopped around 1pm in the microscopic to town of Blackburn MO, where amazingly there was a small cafe that was open: Ed&rsquo;s Burgers and Beer. Super shoestring operation, just one guy, Ed. He turned out to be a late 60&rsquo;s early 70 dude with lots of grey hair and a friendly demeanor.</p>
<p>The ride today:</p>

<p>We are camping in a county fairground, lots of space and lots of nice level places to pitch tents.  No showers however, drat!  Everyone is super sweaty and gross, I would pay a lot of money to take a good shower at this point. I did run into a local cyclist person from the town who said that he might be able to call soeone from the parks department to get us into the swim center.</p>
