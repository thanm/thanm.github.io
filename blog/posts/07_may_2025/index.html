<p>Camping in Lieber State Recreation Area near Cloverdale, seems like a pretty basic state park, showers and electricity but not a lot else. The cell coverage is unfortunately really poor, enough for short text messages but little else (blogging and using my laptop via hotspot are completely out of the question, and cell calls seem to get dropped after about 15 or 20 seconds).</p>
<p>Tomorrow is going to be laundry day; Dennis has promised us that there is a laundromat within easy striking distance of our camping spot &ndash; I definitely need to wash some stuff at this point.</p>
