          <p>Slightly soggy start for this ride, but we managed to get organized and on the road at the appointed hour. So far my tent has been handling to wet weather ok. I rode with the gang for an hour or so, then picked up the pace and rode with Mike into Lancaster OH, and then on into Circlevill, a nice medium-sized city where the van was stopped at  Kroer for food shopping.</p>
<p>Riding with Mike:</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18X-SLekXGcNKpZpiummxPNXLk4oxQmc5/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>Second half of the ride I did mostly on my own, which may have been a strategic mistake, since the headwind was fierce. Arrived at the campsite again a bit before the first rain cloud opened up, and was able to get my tent pitched. Mike cooked a nice dinner, and we sheltered from the rain under our canopy.</p>
<p>Alas, Deer Creek Lake State Park was not a happy place for me in the evening and overnight.  A bunch of other campers had pulled up next to our site (well after I had pitched my tent) and they made a real ruckus all evening, talking loudly and playing music and carrying on. I went out around 10:30 to ask them to quiet down, but that had just about zero effect.  Also: around 7:30 or so there was a huge downpour, at which point I discovered that the flat place I&rsquo;d pitched my tent on had filled up with water, so my tent got good and soaked (lots of water circulating around on the floor inside).</p>
<p>Not a great night, but what the heck, you can&rsquo;t win them all, and the good thing about being on a tour like this is that every day you roll on to a new place with new and better prospects&hellip;</p>
