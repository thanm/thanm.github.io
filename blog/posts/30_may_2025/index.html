<p>Not a whole lot of blog-worthy stuff happening today, mainly just errands, relaxation, and laundry.</p>
<p>I did cycle past the lovely Poudre river on my way to the UPS store, photo below. There is also supposedly a really nice bike trail that runs along it out to the east, but (for obvious reasons) I don&rsquo;t think anyone in our group is going to be exploring it. We will see much more of the western part this weekend however.</p>

<p>Dinner in the old town at an Irish pub place, we had a couple of beers and I had a plate of fish and chips.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: the Poudre river canyon ride, route looks awesome.</p>
