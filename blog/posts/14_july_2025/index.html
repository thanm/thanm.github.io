If you&rsquo;re just arriving at the blog for the first time, try looking first at the about section, then maybe read the first post and a few of the riding day posts. Two of my all time favorite riding days were from Sisters, Oregon to McKenzie Bridge Oregon and from Fort Collins, Colorado to Rustic Colorado, but heck, there were a ton of other very beautiful rides as well.  The posts page lists all the tour days in chronological order, so you can go through the whole thing if that suits you." />
