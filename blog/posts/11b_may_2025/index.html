<p>We had a couple of long stops, one for coffee in Saint Charles, then another stop in the town of Defiance, where there was a nice (and extremely crowded) brew pub.</p>
<p>Our campground (&ldquo;Klondike County Park Campground&rdquo;) is basic but seems fairly quiet &ndash; no wifi and only a few spots for electricity but basic showers and a good spot for gathering near the parking lot.</p>
<p>Lovely full moon in the evening; a bunch of us took a short stroll after dinner around the lake here in camp (it was apparently an old sandstone quarry).</p>
