<p>Good night&rsquo;s sleep last night in Caesar Creek State Park, very quiet. Lots of dew and condensation inside the tent in the morning tho.  Cool weather to start, 48 degrees.</p>
<p>Long ride today: 73.6 miles, 3139 feet of elevation gain, riding time around 5 hours 30 mins. The wind thankfully had changed up a bit and we didn&rsquo;t have to contend with headwinds, that was definitely a blessing. I rode mostly with Chet and Tim. Lots of places to stop along the way, many towns &ndash; the most memorable was Franklin OH, where we took a break and had an excellent early lunch of pizza.</p>
<p>Crossing over the state line from Ohio to Indiana was interesting, no marker, but the road immediately turned from nice pavement to sketchy patched pavement to gravel over the course of a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>Camping at Whitewater Memorial State Park, which seems nice &ndash; lots of room, very spread out.  Hoping that there won&rsquo;t be too much noise (I can hear someone&rsquo;s stereo playing in the distance as I type).</p>
