Much much easier ride than yesterday &ndash; around the same on paper (61 miles, 2500 feet of elevation) but mild headwinds (7-10mph) and as opposed to the gale force stuff we had on our previous ride.

<p>Crossing into Nebraska:</p>

<p>We rode through the town of Red Cloud, the childhood home of Willa Cather, that was interesting. Brought back good memories of her books (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_%C3%81ntonia">&ldquo;My Antonia&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Comes_for_the_Archbishop">&ldquo;Death Comes to the Archbishop&rdquo;</a>).</p>

<p>Camping at yet another city park, but this one in Franklin seems like another nice one.</p>

<p>It was my night to cook, along with Mel. We made quesadillas for an appetizer, then pasta puttanesca, broccoli, salad, bacon bits. It was well received.</p>
<p>Looking forward to our rest day on Saturday in McCook NE &hellip;</p>
