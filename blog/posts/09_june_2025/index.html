          <p>Today we had our first cycling day in Yellowstone National Park, it was a good one, not too strenuous but with some excellent scenery &ndash; around 44 miles and a bit less than 2000 feet of elevation gain. Yellowstone for some reason doesn&rsquo;t allow cyclists to enter the park at the south entrance (?), so we actually wound up piling all our bikes onto the van then hopping in the van ourselves, at which point Dan drove us into the park to Grant Village. From there we cycled north and west to the Madison Junction (in the west part of the park) where we will camp at the Madison campground.</p>
<p>Ride was great; there were quite a lot of cars (especially in the post-lunch parts of the ride) but the cars were well-behaved for the most part, and in the really high-traffic spots (near the geyser parks) it was actually a bit of an advantage to be on a bike.</p>
<p>Very spotty cell coverage in the park, and in particular zero coverage in our campground, so any interactions with the internet have to be done elsewhere. The campground is lovely and in a great spot near the river, but also doesn&rsquo;t have any showers, so we&rsquo;ll have to finagle something for that.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>Chet and Terry are cooking tonight; for grins I decided to hop in the van and come along for the ride to the grocery store just to see what the town of West Yellowstone looks like (it is larger than I expected; lots of restaurants and clearly well-prepared for enslaughts of tourists).</p>
