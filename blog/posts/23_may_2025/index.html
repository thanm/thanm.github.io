None of us were interested in riding very quickly, the pace was leisurely. We stopped in Cambridge NE at a nice coffee shop, Shirley K&rsquo;s, mug of joe for $1.25 (with refills) and some nice conversations with curious locals. Took our time there." />

          <p>Nice breakfast again provided by the lovely folks from the Arapahoe Methodist church, it featured some tasty egg casseroles, along with biscuits and sausage gravy, yum. Rain this morning early, but it had pretty much cleared by the time we hit the road, so the conditions were good. We had a pretty decent tailwind to boot.</p>
<p>None of us were interested in riding very quickly, the pace was leisurely. We stopped in Cambridge NE at a nice coffee shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShirleyKsCoffeeShop">Shirley K&rsquo;s</a>, mug of joe for $1.25 (with refills) and some nice conversations with curious locals. Took our time there.</p>
<p>Ride profile. You will note from the elevation chart that we seem to be steadily gaining altitude &ndash; this is not a fluke, apparently it will be like this all the way to Fort Collins.</p>

<p>Marker on the ride to Cambridge:</p>

<p>From then it was on to the next town, Indianola. Apparently it was a POW camp during world war II:</p>

<p>We happened upon this interesting place &ndash; license plates from all over. It was closed up though so we never did figure out exactly what it was:</p>

<p>A shot of the local Casey&rsquo;s, encountered along the ride. This outfit is like the 7-11 of the midwest, I think we started seeing them on the side of the road in Missouri, and from then on through Kansas and Nebraska they were everywhere. Good place to stop when cycling, they have good snacks and clean bathrooms.</p>

<p>The motel in McCook (&ldquo;Horse Creek Inn&rdquo;) looks fine, and to my delight a package from Amy with some goodies and supplies was waiting for me when I checked in &ndash; I felt very pampered.</p>
<p>Rest day tomorrow, it will be laundry, relaxing, and maybe a little shopping.</p>
