          <p>Today&rsquo;s ride was another really challenging one, on paper even more difficult than the previous day&rsquo;s killer, but to be honest I found it a tiny bit easier, perhaps because it was more predictable (no chaos/mayhem introduced by routing around a bridge closure).</p>
<p>The first 20 miles or so featured nice scenery albeit with plenthy of hills, our route took us up to and around a big man-made lake near the town of Smithville. We stopped for a snack in the town of Paradise MO:</p>

<p>I rode with Mike today for the entire time, it was a good combo. From Smithville to Platte City a little wind and tons of hills &ndash; basically you would finish working yuour way up to the top of one hill, then at the top you could see a big dip and then the top of the next hill waiting for you in the distance.  Lunch in Platte City outside the county courthouse.</p>
<p>A shot of hills appearing in the distance:</p>

<p>The ride map:</p>

<p>From Platte City we rode due northwest, and at this point the winds really started to pick up, so we had strong, gusting cross-winds and partial headwinds for a long stretch (maybe the next 25 miles), then for the last 5 or so due west into Atchison we were fighting our way through what seemed like gale-force headwinds (in reality more like 15-20 mph baseline with gusts up to 25-30), a real kick in the teeth. Whew!</p>
<p>Photo entering Kansas. This is just after we finished our killer headwind stretch, and before crossing a big bridge over the Missouri river:</p>

<p>We are staying at Warnock Lake Park and Camground, which has a bit of a state park feel but is operated by the city I think. Lovely spot and nice scenery, but pretty disgusting bathrooms with uncooperative lights (showers are not great either).</p>
<p>Super super windy, we didn&rsquo;t even try to pitch our tents until the wind died down a bit after dinner. Here&rsquo;s a photo of Mel taking shelter inside our trailer so as to be able to have a phone conversation:</p>

<p>No matter, since it is a zero day for us tomorrow, our first in a couple of weeks (13 days straight riding back to back). Yay!</p>
<p>Arlen and I cooked dinner this evening, we did a sort of make-your-own burrito thing (menu inspired by Arlen). I wound up doing probably a tiny bit more than my share since Arlen was tied up driving people to and from bike shops to deal with various broken bike issues.</p>
