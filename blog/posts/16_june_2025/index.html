          <p>Zero day in Missoula, really good to rest my legs and get recharged/reorganized. The usual stuff: laundry, repacking, working on my bike, stretching, napping. I also went out and bought a new bike lock (my old lock is still fine, but I somehow lost the key to it that I brought).</p>
<p>Also decided to hedge my bets a little on my tires, I was able to find a bike shop that had the exact model I am running, so I bought a single tire as a spare. Photo:</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough how happy I am with these tires, I should add. They are big and solid enough to handle all sorts of horrendous bumps and debris, but they do well on the pavement as well. Can&rsquo;t quite believe it, but I still have yet to get a flat (probably mostly luck, but I think the tires have something to do with it too).</p>
<p>Mel and Chet and I went to a veggie/vegan place for lunch today, I ordered a really superb Brussels Caesar salad (photo). Great to have a nice big bown of greens for a change instead of a small portion.</p>

<p>I did at least a minimal amount of wandering around in the town to see what things looked like. They have a nice riverside park with a carousel in it, I was happy to see that:</p>

<p>Mural encountered on one of our walks:</p>

<p>Still a bit under the weather with a cold, but hopefully it will have blown over by tomorrow. I am making dinner tomorrow night with Terry, so we&rsquo;ll need to do the shopping this evening (our destination, Powell Idaho, is microscopic and doesn&rsquo;t have any sort of food store).</p>
