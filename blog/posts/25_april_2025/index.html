          <p>Nice weather to start the day &ndash; I had a big of trouble sleeping the night before, but my head was clear and I was ready to ride by the time the 8am start time arrived.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the ride startying in Cumberland was fantastic &ndash; first day on the GAP (Great Allegheny Passage) trail, which follows a defunct rail line. First 25 miles or so uphill at a slight grade (2%) and then a long descend (1% grade down) into Confluence. That long downhill was delightful, really nice conditions.</p>
<p>Along the way we stopped at the Mason-Dixon line (I learned a few things about those two guys) and at the continental divide. We stuck together more as a group this time around, that was nice as well. Couple of interesting tunnels, including the Big Savage (biggest one we have been through yet) and some nice bridges.</p>
<p>Warning: the ride link below is pretty messed up, I selected the wrong route when starting out from Cumberland, which greatly confused my software, so take this with a graion of salt:</p>

<p>Confluence is not a big town, but there was a decent campground with plenty of room to spread out. The camp was right at the base of a dam, with a very small hyrdo power installation beside it (one of the smallest I have seen). Also a very active trout fishing spot &ndash; apparently the water coming out the dam is very cold, making for some happy trout.</p>
<p>Bit of rain towards the end of the ride, just misty stuff however no need for real raingear. Nice dinner cooked by Terrence and Mike.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative chunk of the GAP trail &ndash; fairly wide, nice cinder surface in most places:</p>

<p>A nice view from one of the overlooks &ndash; nice scenery.</p>

<p>This shot is of the Borden tunnel, one of the smaller ones (Big Savage is a good bit larger):</p>

<p>Our campground in Confluence below. The thing in the background that looks like a huge wall is actually a dam (there is car driving along the top of it for scale).</p>
