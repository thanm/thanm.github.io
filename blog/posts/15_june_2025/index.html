          <p>Happy father&rsquo;s day :-)</p>
<p>Came down with a cold&hellip; last night I was having symptoms, and this morning I had a sore throat, congestion, the usual stuff. It was on the mild side though so I decided to go ahead with the ride. I think I made the right decision &ndash; I had enough energy to power my way through the biking in spite of the sniffles (hopefully I can fully recover during our upcoming rest day).</p>
<p>Our route today was due north from Darby to Missoula, first along the highway for around 12 miles, then the rest of the way on a bike path that paralleled the highway. This was definitely a ride to get from point A to point B, there were not a lot of interesting places to stop or sights to see, so I pretty much got on with it. Pretty fair headwind for the last 25 miles or so.</p>

<p>View of the start of the bike path (this was one of the nicer sections, there were other bits that were pretty chewed up):</p>

<p>The road and the path followed (roughly) the Bitterroot river, a lovely one: big, fast-flowing, clear, cold:</p>

<p>I stopped around mile 45 in the smaller town of Florence at a gas station around 11 and was able to have another video call with Amy, which was nice (she was in a laundromat in Riga Latvia of all places).</p>
<p>The path got a little nicer in the final runup to Missoula, and eventually we crossed over the Clark Fork river, a huge one that the Bitterroot flows into:</p>

<p>Once we arrived in Missoula downtown we were directed to ride to the ACA (Adventure Cycling Association) headquarters, which we did. A shot of the ACA building:</p>

<p>Once there we had was a fair amount of thumb-twiddling while we waited for all of the riders to accumulate (one had had a flat, others had stopped for coffee and rests, etc). I wandered around a bit for grins while waiting, some photos:</p>
<p>Missoula contemporary art museum door (which for unknown reasons has this kayak attached to it):</p>

<p>There was originally supposed to be a &ldquo;barbecue&rdquo; a bit before 4 (???), which later got changed to lunch at 1pm (???) so there was some confusion over all of that. The complete gang did eventually roll in and we all had some amount of non-barbecue random food to eat.</p>
<p>We then had an informal tour of the building given by one of the ACA staffers, that was mildly interesting (especially the photos from back in the 70&rsquo;s of the various inaugural rides (ex: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikecentennial">Bike Centennial</a>) that got things kicked off. Shots from inside the office (up high you can see various interesting bikes that have been preserved as exhibits):</p>

<p>This is the bike that Lael Wilcox used to set the Contintental Divide Trail race record:</p>

<p>After various photos were taken we finally made our way down a few blocks to the motel, everyone super tired by that point.</p>
<p>Dinner at a Mexican restaurant a short walk back into the main part of town, food was tasty but it was a tad on the expensive side. It was nice to eat real food though, with something other than our mess kits. The weather was also quite nice (our table was outdoors).</p>
