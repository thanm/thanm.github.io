The cue sheet was dead simple, just get on state route 36 for 63 miles, but the whole stretch had 20-30 mph headwinds with gusts that were stronger, so we had to dig deep for every mile, we really had our rear ends kicked up down and sideways.
I had to pedal hard just to make 10 or 11 mph; on the hills we were down to 6 or 7 mph (total elevation gain 2567). Six and a half hours of riding time, average speed of 10.5 mph. The road was decent overall, most sections had pretty good shoulders and the surface was quite good; traffic was modest except for the last couple of hours." />

          <p>Incredibly challenging ride today, one of the hardest rides I can recall doing.</p>
<p>The cue sheet was dead simple, just get on state route 36 for 63 miles, but the whole stretch had 20-30 mph headwinds with gusts that were stronger, so we had to dig deep for every mile, we really had our rear ends kicked up down and sideways.</p>
<p>I had to pedal hard just to make 10 or 11 mph; on the hills we were down to 6 or 7 mph (total elevation gain 2567). Six and a half hours of riding time, average speed of 10.5 mph. The road was decent overall, most sections had pretty good shoulders and the surface was quite good; traffic was modest except for the last couple of hours.</p>
<p>There were some really beautiful vistas along the way, one in particular where we were up on a rise and surrounded by green hay fields and by windmills in every direction as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>The stops were nice &ndash; we peeled off from the route in Belleville and visited a coffee place (&ldquo;The Feathered Nest&rdquo;) with good java and friendly folks, then in Courtland KS we stopped at &ldquo;The Depot Market&rdquo;, which had nice produce (including fresh locally grown asparagus, Mike bought three bunches) and ice cream.</p>
<p>The ride:</p>

<p>On the road to Mankato &ndash; windmills, nice little puffy clouds, a lovely scene:</p>

<p>Mankato campground:</p>

<p>Lots of comatose riders after the difficult ride:</p>

<p>Camping at the city park here in Mankato (pronounced like &ldquo;Man Cave Toe&rdquo;); plenty of space, good common area. Weather is decent, breezy and sunny, not too hot.</p>
<p>Asparagus picked up along the way:</p>

<p>Dinner cooked by Terry and Simona &ndash; fabulous meal, lots of nice veggies including the asparagus that we picked up at the local farmer&rsquo;s market.</p>
<p>Our campground was visited by a very friendly and social cat &ndash; young, male, not neutered, super social, investigating everyone and everything. No collar, maybe a stray? But very human-centric for a stray. He tried with a whole bunch of us to invade our tents around bedtime (looking for a place to sleep I assume), but I shooed him off pronto, and I think everyone else did the same (inflatable sleeping pads not compatible with cat claws thank you very much).</p>
