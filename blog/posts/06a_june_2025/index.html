Super strong rider, but she was apparently just not able to sleep well and was getting more and more exhausted as time went on.
Can&rsquo;t really fault her for making her exit given the sleep issues &ndash; if I was only sleeping an hour a night I think that would be a deal breaker for me as well.  It is hard enough to do these rides even with good sleep and nutrition, but without good rest I think it would be nearly impossible." />

<p>We wished her the best, I hope that she will be able to rest and recharge and make another go at the second part of the tour at some point.</p>
