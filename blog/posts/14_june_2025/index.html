          <p>Another nice ride in Montana, by the numbers 60 miles and 1500 feet of elevation, but with a big downhill section towards the end, which helped a lot. Very nice clear weather, sky completely cloudless for whole morning and most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The downhill at mile 27 was awesome &ndash; a bit more than seven miles at 7% grade, we were really flying along. The last 25 was a little trying since we had headwinds, but they were fairly mild winds, so no big deal.</p>

<p>At mile 10 of the ride we stopped at a National Park visitor&rsquo;s center devoted to the site of a battle between the Nez Perce tribe and the US military back in the 19th century &ndash; pretty sad chapter in US history. Spent most of an hour watching a movie and looking over the exhibits.</p>
<p>As with many other Native American tribes they signed a series of treaties with the US government, each one successively shrinking their territory, then finally they balked when the next US-proposed agreement would have reduced their land by 90% &hellip; at a certain point after that they were on the run (fleeing from a group of US troops who were trying to take their horses away and relocate them) &hellip; then in the Big Hole river valley they were attacked at 3AM by troops again while camped resulting in a huge massacre of women and children. Pretty painful stuff to learn about, but there was a lot of that going on back then.</p>
<p>Nez Perce battle memorial park site:</p>

<p>I thought this was a neat exhibit at the center, showing some of the techniques the Nez Perce craftspeople were using for beadwork (using porcupine quills to hold your beads, cool idea).</p>

<p>Some pix of the campground. We are at the Traveler&rsquo;s Rest RV park, seems like a nice location.</p>

<p>Tim and Tom cooking tonight, we&rsquo;ll see what they come up with (I heard rumors of rotisserie chicken, mmm).</p>
<p>Very much looking forward to reaching Missoula tomorrow and taking a zero day off the next day&hellip; I am ready for a bit of down time.</p>
