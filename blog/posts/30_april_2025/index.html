          <p>Super lovely weather for cycling this morning &ndash; around 49 or 50 at the start, cool breezes, sunshine.We started our ride with a trip across an old suspension ridge to take us over the river and into Ohio. First 10 miles or the ride were a bit twisty and turny but we eventually made our way to some nice country roads and traveled west. Total of 60 miles, today, but real hills this time (3800 feet of elevation gain). Some of the climbs were steep, we had to really work in spots.</p>
<p>This part of Ohio seems very agricultural, lots of hayfields and the occasional dairy or cattle-raising operation.</p>

<p>[No photos yet for this ride, there is no WiFi at the campsite here I&rsquo;m afraid; will update later.]</p>
<p>Our campground, Seneca Lakes Parkside, is nice &ndash; very large (a ridiculous number of sites, very spread out), and with a tent camping area that has a nice view of the lake.</p>
<p>Camping area (apparently for scouts) with our hand wash station set up:</p>
