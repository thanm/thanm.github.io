          <p>New state; Colorado, huzzah! Extra short ride today, 38 miles, so the cooks in charge of breakfast decided to do a really nice one using the church kitchen: bacon, eggs, and pancakes with maple syrup, yum.  When we finally finished all the cleanup, packing, etc it was around 8:30 but still raining lightly&hellip; we sat around for a while trying to decide whether it was going to stop, but eventually just headed out into the wet after all. Not a big deal, it wasn&rsquo;t a soaking rain, just little bitty misty drops. Riding was good, road a bit rough but there was a decent shoulder most of the way, and the traffic wasn&rsquo;t all that bad.</p>
<p>Lot of grumbling from the gang when we rolled in about how cold the ride had been, and how they couldn&rsquo;t seem to get warm&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t an issue at all for me, I did just fine.  I think all those years of biking to work in MA during the winter months appear to have paid off I guess.</p>
<p>We encountered our first west-to-east Transam rider this morning, a bearded older man doing it self-supported, so all loaded up with racks + panniers + bags. Nice guy, he said that he and his brother had started in Oregon and ridden together for a while, then the brother peeled off and decided to take the Northern Tier route, while he headed south towards the Katy trail in Missouri.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll note from the elevation profile of this ride that we did another slow steady climb again, inching our way up to the 4900 feet we&rsquo;ll be hitting in Fort Collins. High-altitude biking here we come&hellip;</p>

<p>Tim and Deb are cooking tonight, we&rsquo;ll see what they come up with. It will be another one of these ridiculously well-equipped church kitchens, I almost feel a bit jealous.</p>
