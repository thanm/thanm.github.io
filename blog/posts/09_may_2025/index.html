<p>Coffee at Joe Sipper&rsquo;s in Effingham, a very pleasant establishment. Stopped again in Altamont at the Charles M Wright house, good spot to sit for a bit and eat lunch.</p>

<p>With some tailwinds we pulled in on the early side at the Okaw Valley Campground outside of Vandalia, a very nice private CG establishment, enjoyed staying there.  There was a bit of waiting around at that point &ndash; normally our van with its trailer is there at the campground when we show up, but for some reason Simona and Dennis were tied up and didn&rsquo;t roll in until later.</p>

<p>It was my night to cook (with Terry), we eventually made out way with Simona to a nearbyhb Walmart and shopped for groceries. I think an integral part of the cooking experience on these ACA tours is being in a big grocery store in some place you&rsquo;ve never heard of, running around trying to track down the ingredients you need (definitely describes our experience that afternoon).</p>
<p>Terry and I made German potato salad (which was great), sauteed mustard greens, some veggie dumplings for our two vegetarians, fruit salad, then we retooled/repuposed a bunch of leftovers from the night before (we had a bit too much food at that meal). Overall a nice meal.</p>
