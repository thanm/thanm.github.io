<p>We had a time zone switch, so we gained an hour, which is nice.</p>

<p>Casey turns out to be an interesting town &ndash; according to Simona there were a couple of factories here that supported a lot of the working folks, and around 12 years ago those factories all shut down (I assume moved to some other lower-wage locale). For a while this was a major economic crisis for the town, particularly for the shops and restaurants. Then a local businessman decided that he would build the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s largest wind chime&rdquo; (imagine a set of wind chimes about the size of a tree) so as to bring in tourist visitors from I70. Lo and behold, his scheme worked, so he and others wound up building a bunch of other &ldquo;worlds largest&rdquo; objects (rocking chair, mailbox, pencil, etc) and as of today the town&rsquo;s shops and businesses seem to be on at least a decent standing.</p>
<p>Today was supposed to be a laundry day (definitely needed) but when we arrived at the town laundromat we found it all boarded up &ndash; according to the lady in the ice cream shop, someone broke into the place a week or so ago and they shut it down and boarded it up while they decide how to fix it. Whaaa? Who would have guessed &hellip;</p>
<p>Big rainstorm a little while after we arrived, it blew in quickly and started dumping rain on us (at that point most folks had successfully pitched theirs tents), so we had another small &ldquo;wait out the rain&rdquo; episode starting around 2:45.</p>
