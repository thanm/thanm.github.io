          <p>Today was the first of our big climbs in the Rockies &ndash; we tackled Cameron pass, at 10,200 feet, as part of a 56 mile to Walden CO (elevation gain 3500 feet whew).</p>
<p>It was a good night&rsquo;s sleep for me at the campground, I woke once around midnight and got a good view of the stars on my way to visit the bathroom. In the morning we had a gusty, dry breeze, meaning that my tent was pretty much dry when I went to pack it up.</p>
<p>Similar weather to yesterday, 60s/70s with sunshine, breezy, ideal riding conditions.  The path up to the pass was less busy than the ride yesterday in terms of traffic and there really wasn&rsquo;t much in the way or shops or cafes to stop at. No matter, it was a fine ride with great views of the mountains, starting out green and then towards the end all snow-capped.</p>

<p>I rode with Mike today up to the top of the pass, then on my own for the remainding 30+ miles to Walden. I was definitely working during the ascent, and feeling the effects of the altitude.</p>
<p>On the road to the pass:</p>

<p>At the pass:</p>

<p>The descent from the pass was nice, there was a speedy bit for the first five miles or so and then it leveled off. There was a bit of headwind, and later on towards Walden it began to rain, but nothing major in that department. Great views of the surrounding peaks along the way.</p>

<p>On the way down I stopped at a park visitor&rsquo;s center that specialized in moose. Apparently this area has a sizeable population of moose, there was some nice swampy areas that are perfect moose habitat.</p>

<p>Selfie with moose sculpture (which interestingly enough is made entirely of used barbed wire):</p>

<p>After the pass, the road empties out into an area called North Park, which is a classic high plains valley, lovely green grasslands framed by a ring of snow-covered mountains:</p>

<p>Later sections of the road to Walden also had some nice flowers (lupines it looks like):</p>

<p>The very last part of the ride went past the Arapahoe National Wildlife Refuge, which is apparently highest national wildlife refuge in the nation at 8200 feet of elevation; looked lovely.</p>

<p>Once in Walden we arrived in the city park where we were supposed to have camped, only to discover that the park bathroom was locked. When our leader Dan called the city to ask them to unlock it, they basically refused (not clear why, possibly because the water line nearby was being worked on). Not the greatest way to end a ride, especially since it was still raining at that point and we were all getting cold.</p>
<p>No bathrooms is pretty much a deal-breaker for us, so after many phone calls and multiple attempts to arrange some other option (high school, or some other campground) we eventually wound up in a nearby motel. Fine with me, although hopefully won&rsquo;t create too many budget problems later on in the trip. Motel:</p>

<p>Mike and Dan cooking tonight, this is a tiny town so they are going to have to shop at Dollar General, always an adventure.</p>
