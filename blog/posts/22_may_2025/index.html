Nebraska definitely feels like a &ldquo;big sky&rdquo; country; there were a couple of points where we stopped on the ride and just soaked in the expanse: farmland (corn) from one horizon to another. Still definitely with a drier and scrubbier feel to the vegetation and the terrain." />

<p>Seen on the road. Unfamiliar with that steer breed&hellip;</p>

<p>We had a really nice stop at mile 22 or so in the town of Alma, they had a place called the <a href="http://dragonflydesserts.com/">Dragonfly Cafe</a> &ndash; I had a large coffee and a caramel pecan roll, which was superb. In fact it was so good I went back in and ordered another one. Also encountered in the cafe was a mom with two month old triplets (in their baby carriers, sleeping), super cute. Don&rsquo;t see that very often.</p>
<p>Cafe exterior:</p>

<p>The killer carmel pecan roll:</p>

<p>Next door to the cafe. I thought this was kind of an entertaining name for a hair salon (Deb BTW managed to squeeze in a haircut from these folks):</p>

<p>Mike and I stopped for lunch in Oxford (not too much going on there). I enjoyed a tomato-and-avocado sandwich for lunch (with hot sauce):</p>

<p>In Arapahoe the lovely people running the local Methodist church agreed to let us stay there overnight (yay, no tent pitching), and even better offered to host a potluck dinner for us. Outstanding! I am feeling very pampered already&hellip;</p>

<p>Looking forward to sleeping indoors tonight, then a nice short (45 miles) ride to McCook NE where we will be having a day off.</p>
