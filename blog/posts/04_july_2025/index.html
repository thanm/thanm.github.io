<p>I am a bit scruffier and a bit lighter, the post-trip weigh-in had me at 160 pounds on the scale, so it looks like I&rsquo;ve dropped a bit over ten pounds. The post-tour version of me:</p>

<p>So glad to be home! Seventy five days is a long time to be on the road, and especially long if you are tent camping for most of the time.</p>
<p>It was great to see my pup Ellie as well, I missed her and all the various parts of my doggie-centric existence (the daily walks, the snuggle sessions on the couch, you name it).</p>

<p>I am going to do a final retrospective post on my gear (and such) in the next couple of days, then probably time to put this blog to bed&hellip;</p>
