<p>We are staying in a Methodist church here in Imperial, yay &ndash; super happy about not having to pitch my tent (especially given that it is supposed to rain tonight).</p>
<p>Here I am geared up for the ride ready to leave McCook &ndash; hope for the best, prepare for the worst as the saying goes:</p>

<p>Paradise NE at mile 28 basically looked like a ghost town for all intents and purposes; we stopped there hoping for some sort of store but found nothing. Then a pickup truck that was rolling slowly down the street stopped, Terry went over to chat the guy up &hellip; he got out his phone and made a call, and lo-and-behold, a bearded man in jeans appeared out of nowhere, unlocked the general store, and we got to go inside and have coffee and snacks.</p>
<p>Post office in Wauneta, mile 45:</p>

<p>Nothing open there except the Sinclair gas station, which (ironically) was really hopping.</p>
<p>A shot of the church where we are staying in Imperial:</p>

<p>We are on mountain time now, as well &ndash; gained an hour. Tomorrow we will be crossing over into Colorado, huzzah.</p>
<p>Chet and Mike are cooking, we will see what they whip up in the kitchen.</p>
