	<meta name="description" content="Rest day in Yellowstone today. This comes on the back of another rest day this past Sunday and a light cycling day on Monday so I am hoping that this will really give my legs a chance to recover from our giant rides last week.
For entertainment most of us piled into the van today and we toured around the park to view the wildlife and see the sights. Got some good bear and bison sightings, that was fun, and we made the obligatory visit to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which I have seen before but appreciated almost as much as the first time (back in 2011)." />
