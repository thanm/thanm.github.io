          <p>A short post to reflect on biking gear and such for this trip so far:</p>
<p>At the top of the list is my bike, which has been absolutely rock solid, super happy with it so far. No mechanical issues, it has ridden well, the tires have performed superbly, the various bags have adequate space. Gold star on that front. I was nervous when I started the trip since virtually everyone else on the tour is riding a road bike (mostly Trek Domane&rsquo;s) but my gravel bike with the big tires is doing me just fine.</p>
<p>Tent has been good; in the cases where I had rain leakage it was mostly about my less-than-perfect choice of spot to pitch it (I am now much more of an expert on that). Sleeping bags just fine, sleeping pad has been comfy and reliable.</p>
<p>Rainwear has been ok &ndash; the &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; shoe covers I brought along turn out to be not really waterproof, but for the rainy rides I&rsquo;ve just been using hiking gaters and in combination with my boots that has worked out well. Jacket and rain pants have been fine.</p>
<p>Clothing wise I think I probably could have gone a little lighter (2 pairs of bike shorts instead of 3, that sort of thing) but you never know when it comes to that and it is good to have at least a bit of extra clothing in reserve.</p>
<p>I am also super happy that I am doing the van-supported version of this trip and not the self-supported version, it is great to be able to pack up two good sized duffle bags and throw them in the trailer every morning, amen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how things go for the second thousand miles, but so far so good with the equipment.</p>
