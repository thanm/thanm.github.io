Today&rsquo;s ride was a tough one: 69 miles with 4600 ft elevation gain. I rode with the pack for the first half or so of the ride, we stopped for lunch in the tiny town of Chandlersville. Lo and behold a local boy scout troop had built a little covered pavilion with picnic tables, perfect spot for a break. Across the street was a small and crusty-looking antique nicknack shop; Deb went in to ask if she could use their bathroom, and when she came out she was holding cold bottles of water for all of us (super nice guy there just gave them to us). Shopping in Zanesville at the Riesbeck market (large and well stocked)." />

          <p>Lovelty sunrise this morning, and it was a good night sleeping, so something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ride was a tough one: 69 miles with 4600 ft elevation gain. I rode with the pack for the first half or so of the ride, we stopped for lunch in the tiny town of Chandlersville. Lo and behold a local boy scout troop had built a little covered pavilion with picnic tables, perfect spot for a break. Across the street was a small and crusty-looking antique nicknack shop; Deb went in to ask if she could use their bathroom, and when she came out she was holding cold bottles of water for all of us (super nice guy there just gave them to us). Shopping in Zanesville at the Riesbeck market (large and well stocked).</p>
<p>After that the serious climbing began, we had just a ton of up and down for twenty miles or so, and then the last 25 was on state route 40, with again lots of hills (albeit longer and gentler).</p>
<p>Buckeye Lake KOA was our stop for the night; the rain kicked in around the time that I got there and held pretty steadily the whole night. Couple of our riders got caught in the storm and soaked; I managed to avoid the worst of it.</p>
