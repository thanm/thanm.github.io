          <p>Fabulous ride today, really one of the nicest ones yet on the tour if not the best.</p>
<p>Perfect weather, sunny, warm sunshine with cool breezes, decent road conditions (no trucks) but most importantly fabulous scenery. 44 miles or thereabouts, a bit less than 3000 feet of climbing. First part (about 6 miles) was on a bike path leading out of the city, then eventually we switched to SR 14, a two-laner that wound its way up into the mountains.</p>
<p>Route 14 followed the Cache La Poudre river, a good-sized mountain river, clearly very full from snowmelt, water moving at a decent clip.   On the way we had the river on one side, canyon wall on the other, lots of nice rock formations, tons of flowers and hummingbirds (I could hear them the whole way). Just gorgeous stuff.</p>
<p>We did have some climbing but it was fairly gradual, and I could feel some effects from the altitude but nothing too punishing. Nice stop around the 20ish mark at a food+coffee truck to have a breakfast burrito, then another small stop in the town of Rustic just a couple miles before the end of the road.</p>

<p>The campground looks good, small private RV park with decent gathering places and good showers.</p>

<p>Stopped here at the Kind Bean food truck for a breakfast burrito, very tasty second breakfast.</p>

<p>Mishawa Inn &ndash; another good place to stop along the way.</p>

<p>We got a lot of &ldquo;you must be crazy&rdquo; looks from people that we meet on this tour (when we tell them what we&rsquo;re doing), but at one point on this ride I enciountered a couple that were shooting the rapids on stand-up paddle-boards, that is really bonkers:</p>

<p>We went through this small tunnel at one point. This section of the canyon was very narrow, almost a slot canyon, just enough room for the river and the road.</p>

<p>Mel and Terrence are cooking tonight; Mel is going to try to make felafel, huzzah (I am psyched for that).</p>
