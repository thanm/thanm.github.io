          <p>A medium ride today (47 miles) but with a hum-dinger of a climb partway through.</p>
<p>First section was along the Lochsa river again, and at this point in the valley it is a huge, enormous thing: still swift and clear, but a real monster of a river.</p>
<p>One interesting thing we saw along the way was a series of places where people had run improvised cable cars from our side of the river to the opposite side &ndash; Mel told me that they don&rsquo;t allow cars on the opposite side, so if you have a house or a farm you need some way to get gear and people across to it.</p>
<p>At a certain point the trees start to look a little different (more Ponderosas, no more Lodgepole pines or Red Cedars) and then within a half mile the terrain changed completely, much drier, big trees almost gone. It was like someone had thrown a light switch.</p>
<p>Photo of the point during the ride where the terrain changed the first time (at a bend in the river):</p>

<p>From there we turned into the town of Kooskia (had breakfast at the cafe there, very pleasant), then after another four or five miles we turned up into the hills and the climbing began&hellip;</p>
<p>The elevation chart for the ride ahead of time looked fairly bland, but the blob on the elevation chart is deceiving, it looks like it&rsquo;s around a 6 or 7% grade overall, but in reality there were big sections at 12-14%, I had to make extensive use of my lowest gear. Nice views to the south and east though.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>After we finished the climb we were up in a sort of high plain, very wide and level, and completely covered in fields planted with some sort of grain (wheat? barley? not sure). Another completely different look from before.</p>

<p>Mike on the road (I spent pretty much the whole day riding with him):</p>

<p>We have another short-ish ride tomorrow coming into Riggins; from the weather forecast it looks like rain? Then the day after tomorrow we have a real monster of a ride queued up, 80 miles and 4000 feet of elevation gain, eek. Hope we can all survive that.</p>
<p>We are at Bear&rsquo;s Den RV park, it is a nice one.. good gathering area indoors with sofa and comfy chairs, laundry room, good showers. Tent sites are not super level, but it is a nice grassy area. We are supposed to get rain tonight, so I picked my spot carefully to avoid any runoff/drainage issues.</p>
<p>Photo of the tent area:</p>

<p>The indoor gathering area. Tim and I were trying to remember the last place where we actually had a couch to relax on (as best as I can recall it was in McCook Nebraska).</p>

<p>Not sure who is cooking tonight, but I am not in fact all that hungry &ndash; I polished off two sandwiches in addition to my second breakfast in Kooskia, plus some apples, plus some chips, plus some dried fruit, plus a couple of mini snickers bars.   There are times on this trip where I feel as though I am constantly opening my mouth to shovel the food in :-).</p>
