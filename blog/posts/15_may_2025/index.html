          <p>Super challenging ride today, 3000+ elevation gain, 68 miles, a substantial chunk with major headwinds. Not a lot of beautiful scenery or wildlife, just basically a ride to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>We crossed over the Missouri again, that was a crazy section &ndash; very strong crosswind with major gusts, so all of us were trying very hard to stay on the shoulder and not get too close to the (small) guardrail.</p>
<p>The other main event with today&rsquo;s ride was that we had to detour around a bridge that was out (they were building a new one), and we didn&rsquo;t discover the outage until fairly late, so we had to tack on additional mileage in order to get around it (some folks more than others).</p>

<p>The state park we&rsquo;re camping in looks great, not too busy, sites ok, good showers. The one weird thing was that the campsite itself was a fairly longish ride from the park entrance &ndash; with hills, gah.</p>
<p>Mel and Terry made an excellent meal this evening, fried fish, new potatoes, greeen beans, rolls, and cornbread &ndash; yum.</p>
