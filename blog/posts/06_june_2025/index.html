Our ride was largely uphill, 73 miles with 3592 feet of elevation gain. Our route was to the northwest with the big Wind River mountain range off to our left and the Wind River Indian reservation on our right.
The start of the ride was a bit scary, we had a big bank of dark clouds in the southeast looming over us, and the weather report said 25-30% chance of rain, so I dressed warmly and I packed every bit of my rain gear in my backpack as well as my heavy gloves. Oddly though as we rode north the clouds faded and it turned into a really nice day. Certainly not hot, but warm enough that I could use my lighter gloves and hat." />

          <p>Long ride today, and long day in general &ndash; my  night to cook, so that always adds a whole new level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Our ride was largely uphill, 73 miles with 3592 feet of elevation gain. Our route was to the northwest with the big Wind River mountain range off to our left and the Wind River Indian reservation on our right.</p>
<p>The start of the ride was a bit scary, we had a big bank of dark clouds in the southeast looming over us, and the weather report said 25-30% chance of rain, so I dressed warmly and I packed every bit of my rain gear in my backpack as well as my heavy gloves. Oddly though as we rode north the clouds faded and it turned into a really nice day. Certainly not hot, but warm enough that I could use my lighter gloves and hat.</p>
<p>Spectacular scenery, again it was a Wyoming special with wonderful wide open vistas, snow-capped mountains in the distance, wild horses, deer and antelope, and rushing rivers. Really lovely, photos don&rsquo;t do it justice.</p>
<p>The winds were favorable (by Wyoming standards, practically no wind at all) until around mile 45 when we started getting mild headwinds and crosswinds, then for the last 15 or 20 miles it shifted to a strong headwind and we had to fight our way along at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>
<p>Campground here is very nice &ndash; level tent sites, not to crowded, great showers.</p>
<p>I cooked dinner with Dan; I made vegetarian bean thread noodles (nearly a miracle that I was able to find and buy all the necessary ingredients for that dish) along with chicken + salad; I also made cheese quesadillas for appetizer.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>The bad news of the day is that our teammate Deb decided to leave the tour, she was just not able to sleep well and was getting more and more exhausted as time went on.  Can&rsquo;t really fault her for pulling the plug given the sleep issues &ndash; if I was only sleeping an hour a night I think that would be a deal breaker for me as well.</p>
<p>Sky before sunrise in Lander:</p>

<p>This is a view to the left (West) on the early part of the ride. Most of the big peaks in the range were still shrouded in clouds, but every now and then something big and snowy would peek through.</p>

<p>Couple of selfies on the way, one with Mike and one with Tim. They are a lot of fun to ride with, I am lucky to have them on the tour with me &hellip;</p>

<p>Interesting red rocks; the geology has been incredibly varied on these Wyoming rides:</p>

<p>A bunch of folks from our group piled in the van this evening and went off to see the rodeo (first night for it this summer in Dubois). Amazed that they had enough energy after that ride&hellip;</p>
<p>Another big climb tomorrow, including a 9200ft pass, then decent into Grand Teton National Park.  Hope I can get through it (day after that is a rest day, whew).</p>
