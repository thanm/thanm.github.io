<p>We had an off day here in Grand Teton National Park, very much needed at this point after two really challenging and long cycling days. Knees still really stiff, in fact I can&rsquo;t completely bend my left on all the way (eek), feels similar to some of the fallout from my toughest hiking days.</p>
<p>I mainly did laundry and relaxed today&ndash; Chet + Tom + I walked over to the restaurant next to the visitor&rsquo;s center and had a nice breakfast, then later on took a short hike around a nearby peninsula that had nice views of the Tetons, then a pizza lunch with ice cream afterwards (huzzah).</p>

<p>Some flowers along the way:</p>

<p>Tomorrow we head into Yellowstone NP, looking forward to that. We&rsquo;ll have a ride inside the park followed by an overnight stay in the Madison campground.</p>
