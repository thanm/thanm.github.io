Eastern sky in Rawlins, before the sunrise:


We crossed the continental divide today, somewhat puzzling since the spot where it happened seemed rather undistinguished (just a little hill/ridge).


Lovely scenery on this ride, with lots of interesting changes in the landscape and the geology as the ride progressed. Instead of starting sunny and then clouding up later in the day (the pattern for our last handful of rides) it did the opposite, so when we finally rolled into our destination the weather was almost perfect (high 60&rsquo;s, sunny, light breeze)." />

<p>Not a lot of towns/cafes/stores on the route, in fact there was just one: a gas station near Muddy Gap WY around mile 49; we stopped there to east lunch.</p>
<p>Sitting at the table outside the station was another biking couple, a man and a women from the Netherlands. It was fun to chat with them; they are doing an ACA-style trans-am ride but in six week chunks, and staying at inns and hotels.  This latest chunk for them ends in Jackson Wyoming. Our Dutch rider Theo pulled in a few minutes after I did, and he of course had fun chatting them up. Turns out they used to live very close to where Theo does in Utrecht.</p>
<p>My ride recording somehow got messed up today, I am at a loss to explain why. It seems to think that I made a side trip back down to Sinclair in mid trip (which of course did not happen). Confusing.</p>

<p>No campground for us tonight, we are staying at a sort of old-church-turned-hostel-for-itinerant-bikers type dwelling, it is an odd beast. Approaching, with Mike:</p>

<p>From the inside, this is a sort of gymnasium-type room at the rear of the church, then there is a kitchen and a series of smaller rooms on the lower level, with the main part of the church above.</p>
<p>This is the former-gymnasium part. The walls are decorated with drawings and names of other bike riders who have stayed here.</p>

<p>After getting showered and organized, a bunch of us wandered over to the &ldquo;main&rdquo; part of the town, such as it is &ndash; as a town it is barely there, I think the only two establishments were a pottery store and a small bar+grill; we visited both.</p>
