          <p>Another fairly easy ride, 53 miles, 1237 elevation gain, and yet again we had reasonable favorable winds. We were following route 6 again the connecting to route 14, one lane each way, wide shoulder the whole way, decent surface, but the traffic was definitely heavy, with plenty of trucks.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the terrain change during this ride &ndash; at the start in the morning it was corn and wheat fields, surroundings virtually identical to what we were seeing in Nebraska &ndash; then at a certain point things start to change, and by the time you hit Sterling it is a completely different look, scrubby vegetation, very mildly rolling hills, ranchland, much drier (more like what I would expect to see around the Denver area.</p>
<p>We stopped in Haxtun CO and discovered a new coffee place, &ldquo;Phi Cappa Chino&rdquo;, that was an enjoyable interlude at mile 18. Haxtun is about the same size as many of the small towns we passed in Nebraska, but it seemed to have a lot more vitality, didn&rsquo;t have that &ldquo;ghost town&rdquo; atmosphere to it. At Fleming there weren&rsquo;t any services to speak of, but our group stopped at a city park and had lunch.</p>

<p>Also in Haxtun was this mysterious sign near the grain elevator. What do these numbers mean &ndash; is this the price to sell corn? Buy corn? Is it per bushel? Per kilo? Lots of puzzles here. I am sure the locals know exactly how to interpret it.</p>

<p>New terrain on the road to Sterling:</p>

<p>Also interesting on this ride: I definitely noticed the altitude in a couple of sections when I was hill climbing or trying to overtake someone &ndash; even at a wimpy 4500 feet you can tell. More of that coming as we get into the real hills.</p>
<p>City park campground in Sterling:</p>

<p>Weirdly, we had not one but two locals come by and issue dire warnings to us about sleeping in the park &ndash; first a lady who told us that &ldquo;tornados are on the way, the weather is going to get really dangerous&rdquo; (?!?), then guy later on who helpfully offered &ldquo;You should be aware that the crackheads and drug addicts will come by around midnight and steal anything that isn&rsquo;t locked down&rdquo; (?!?!).   Our stay was uneventful however, we had neither tornados (weather was fine) nor visits from crackheads.</p>
<p>Tom and Theo cooking tonight; they are making some sort of Dutch dish that Theo picked out.</p>
<p>Sore back for some reason this afternoon, not sure why (since it was not exactly a heroic ride) &ndash; I will have to spend more time stretching tonight.</p>
