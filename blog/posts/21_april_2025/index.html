          <p>Made it to DC and joined up with the tour group. It is a genial crew &ndash; I enjoyed meeting everyone and beginning the process of getting to know them. We have two guides/leaders &ndash; Simona and Dennis, I am sure they are going to be fun to tour with as well. This morning we grabbed our bikes and headed out on a &ldquo;shakedown&rdquo; ride to make sure everyone&rsquo;s equipment is working properly, etc.  Here&rsquo;s a link to the ride:</p>

<p>About 38 miles, not too fast, almost entirely on bike paths, most of it along the coast of the Potomac. We headed down to the south to the Mount Vernon estate, then came back up and stopped along the river for a ceremonial &ldquo;wheel dip&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After that we crossed over the bridge into DC and looked at some of the memorials (Jefferson, Lincoln). Random photo of riders (a subset) outside the Jefferson:</p>

<p>A gentle introduction to riding together; tomorrow will be the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; day of the tour when we tackle the first 60 miles of the <a href="https://www.canaltrust.org/plan/co-canal-towpath/">C and O canal path</a>.</p>
<p>NB: for me this was more like &ldquo;Day 0&rdquo; (since we were just tooling around DC, not on our way across the USA), but our guides told me in no uncertain terms that we were on Day 2 today, so I&rsquo;m using their numbering system.</p>
