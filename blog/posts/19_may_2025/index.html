<p>Nice mural in the city of Blue Rapids:</p>

<p>The town here is a good deal smaller than Seneca, bit more agricultural, fewer shops. The ride was cool and cloudy starting out, but turned warm and sunny pretty soon, so it was a sweaty affair. I rode with the pack for the first 45 or so and then pushed on ahead with Mike and Chet.  Winds were favorable, which makes a hug difference for these rides.</p>
<p>Photo of my feet! Partyway through the ride (not sure why I am including this). Interestingly I seem to be the only rider on the tour not using clipped in shoes.</p>

<p>The ride:</p>

<p>Staying at a city park attached to the bottom of the county fairgrounds. Thankfully we were able to use the showers attached to the aquatic center just up the way (500 yard walk), everyone was super happy about that. Campground:</p>

<p>This being Kansas and given that the campground was a long way from any solid buildings, they actually had a small tornado shelter nearby:</p>

<p>Last night the weather was pretty fierce, lots of wind, rain, lightning, you name it. One of our riders had his tent collapse due to the wind, and a bunch of folks had water in their tents, so I was pretty glad that I had exercised my option to stay in a motel.</p>
