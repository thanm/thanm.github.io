          <p>Monster ride today &ndash; 81 miles, 4700 feet of elevation gain, three big climbs, light headwinds on most of it, 6 hours 40 minutes riding time. On paper and in practice it was very challenging, no question.</p>
<p>It was also a day for some certified grade-A crazy behavior on the part of one driver we encountered early in the day. I was riding with Tim and Mike, we were going slowly to warm up and chatting about something or other, and at a certain point we got passed by what looked like a dark red minivan with a mountain bike strapped on the back. The van driver yelled something, which we couldn&rsquo;t make out, but we&rsquo;re so used to these sorts of encounters it barely registered. Usually in these situations the driver is unhappy that they had to slow down to pass the bikes safely, or they just don&rsquo;t like bikes on the road, or whatever.</p>
<p>Then things went really haywire &ndash; the van drove up the rode around 200 yards, turned around in a little gravel turnout, and started back towards us. When it was around 50 yards away it actually left the opposite lane and came into our lane, accelerating &ndash; basically trying to run us off the road. I was in the lead, and it took a little bit to just register what was happening (so unexpected); I braked hard and turned off the shoulder and down into the ditch (gravel), meanwhile Tim who was riding behind me slammed into me since he had no time to react to my braking. At that point both of our bikes went down and we hit the ground hard.  I got mostly gravel, Tim got mostly pavement since he hadn&rsquo;t veered off as much. The driver got close to us, yelled something again, then sped off, leaving us both on the ground (Mike had managed to stop without crashing).</p>
<p>Amazingly I had no road rash or cuts, just a couple of bruises. Tim was a lot more beat up, he had a big cut on his hand and a couple on his legs, and he&rsquo;d strained two of his fingers. His bike was pretty knocked around too.</p>
<p>Very weird episode, we really still can&rsquo;t figure out what set this driver off or why they would turn around and make a run at us &ndash; we were riding in our usual manner when the car passed the first time, we never responded to the first yelling and we certainly didn&rsquo;t do anything to provoke.</p>
<p>Spent 20 minutes just recovering and waiting for some of the adrenaline to flush out of our systems; Tim worked on his bike which was bit more beat up than mine.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>I called Simona to let her know what happened; eventually we all got on our bikes and started riding again (Mike and I were mainly concerned about Tim, but he seemed to be willing to give it a shot).</p>
<p>For the first 30 miles of the ride I was basically replaying the whole incident in my mind and trying to get the whole thing processed; we eventually caught up with the other riders. I think I kind of overdid it though since I felt kind of crappy on the rest of the ride; the second and third climbs were a real slog.</p>
<p>Simona and Dan called the police on our behalf and reported the incident, doubt anything will come of it though since we were way to rattled at the time to get a good look at the car or write down the license plate.</p>
<p>I eventually made it to the county fair ground in John Day where were were staying, pitched my tend, got showered &hellip; and then it was my turn to cook dinner, so after a brief phone call with Amy I got the stove going and started to prepare the meal. Terence and I were in charge, I did vegetarian fried rice and a side of broccoli, and he did teryaki chicken (which was really amazingly good, Terence is a whiz when it comes to cooking meat on the stove).</p>
<p>At the start of the ride, the two &ldquo;ghost bikes&rdquo; on top of our van:</p>

<p>Scenery about halfway through the ride, a high valley:</p>

<p>Dixie pass, the third of three:</p>

<p>Dinner! Partially eaten in this case. I served vegan kimchi as a side to the rice:</p>

<p>We also shared our meal with a lone West-to-East trans-am rider (young guy from Brooklyn, early 20&rsquo;s it looked like), it was fun to chat with him. He seems to be managing to travel very light; his bike had about half the gear that I&rsquo;ve seen on other self-supported riders.</p>
<p>Another reasonably big ride tomorrow into Mitchell, around 69 miles. We are supposed to be staying at a highly rated bike hostel as well, looking forward to that.</p>
