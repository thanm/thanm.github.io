Welome to the blog I&rsquo;m keeping to record my trans-American bicycle ride (spring and summer of 2025). After retiring in the summer of 2024, I decided that it might be fun to tackle a &ldquo;big&rdquo; outdoor expedition, while I am still (relatively) fit and capable of doing the longer stuff. I considered various possibilities (through-hike of the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail hike) but eventually settled on riding across the country, inspired by similar trips done by my grad school friend Pete." />

<p>Welome to the blog I&rsquo;m keeping to record my trans-American bicycle ride (spring and summer of 2025). After retiring in the summer of 2024, I decided that it might be fun to tackle a &ldquo;big&rdquo; outdoor expedition, while I am still (relatively) fit and capable of doing the longer stuff. I considered various possibilities (through-hike of the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail hike) but eventually settled on riding across the country, inspired by similar trips done by my grad school friend Pete.</p>
<p>This tour I&rsquo;m participating in is sponsored/run by an outfit called the Adventure Cycling Association, here is a <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/van-supported-tours/transam-express-westward-van/">link</a> that has more details on the ride itself (route and such). The ACA has various options for you to choose from from on its tours; this one is in the &ldquo;van supported&rdquo; level.  What that means is that in addition to the riders there is also a van that goes along on the same route; each day you pack up your gear and throw it on the van, then at the end of the day you retrieve your bags, pitch your tent, and make camp.  There are a few days when we stay in hotel, but really the vast majority of the time we are camping out.</p>
<p>The tour is expected to take around 75 days (with some rest days built into that), and there are roughly a dozen riders taking part.</p>

<p>&lt;Warning, geeky computer stuff here about how the blog is hosted&gt;</p>
<p>This blog is my first foray into using the static web site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, in combination with a custom domain from <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> and some help from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. There are a zillion different ways to write blogs these days and even more ways to host/serve them, but for better or worse this is what I&rsquo;ve picked out. For now :-).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve intentionally set up a robots.txt file to disable search engine indexing, so in theory it should not get crawled by Google or any other search engine (this is mainly in the interests of privacy, since I&rsquo;ll be posting photos of myself and other riders at various points).</p>
