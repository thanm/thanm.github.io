Welome to the blog I&rsquo;m keeping to record my trans-American bicycle ride (spring and summer of 2025). After retiring in the summer of 2024, I decided that it might be fun to tackle a &ldquo;big&rdquo; outdoor expedition, while I am still (relatively) fit and capable of doing the longer stuff. I considered various possibilities (through-hike of the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail hike) but eventually settled on riding across the country, inspired by similar trips done by my grad school friend Pete." />

<p>Welome to the blog I&rsquo;m keeping to record my trans-American bicycle ride (spring and summer of 2025). After retiring in the summer of 2024, I decided that it might be fun to tackle a &ldquo;big&rdquo; outdoor expedition, while I am still (relatively) fit and capable of doing the longer stuff. I considered various possibilities (through-hike of the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail hike) but eventually settled on riding across the country, inspired by similar trips done by my grad school friend Pete.</p>
<p>This tour I&rsquo;m participating in is sponsored/run by an outfit called the Adventure Cycling Association, here is a <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/van-supported-tours/transam-express-westward-van/">link</a> that has more details on the ride itself (route and such). The ACA has various options for you to choose from from on its tours; this one is in the &ldquo;van supported&rdquo; level.  What that means is that in addition to the riders there is also a van that goes along on the same route; each day you pack up your gear and throw it on the van, then at the end of the day you retrieve your bags, pitch your tent, and make camp.  There are a few days when we stay in hotel, but really the vast majority of the time we are camping out.</p>
<p>The tour is expected to take around 75 days (with some rest days built into that), and there are roughly a dozen riders taking part.</p>
<h2 id="amy">Amy</h2>
<p>My support team for this enterprise has been my wife Amy, without whom the tour would not be happening for me. She got the whole thing started by driving me with my bike and all my gear down to DC to the starting point (with the dog, eek), and has been hugely supportive all throughout, sending me care packages and missing bits of gear.   By taking so much time out I am also skipping out on all the things I normally do at home to help with the household &hellip; she has graciously been picking up the slack on my chores (early morning dog walks, planting and weeding the garden, cutting the lawn, you name it) while I am off having my fun. My huge thanks to her!</p>
<h2 id="the-riders-and-tour-leaders">The riders and tour leaders</h2>
<p>The riders are this tour are a good bunch. We have folks from overseas (Australia, Netherlands), folks from the west coast, Wyoming, Arizona, Illinois, Florida, Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Mass (myself). Two women (three including Simona, one of our guides). Most of the gang seems a little but older than I am; they are all retired (who else has time for nonsense like 75 day bike trips?) and all seasoned cyclists. We also have two tour leaders; they take turns between driving the van and riding &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="the-routine">The routine</h2>
<p>The way these tours work is that we have a big van (enough seats for all the riders and both leaders), and a trailer large enough to accommodate all our gear and the various cooking things we need. Every day we pack up all our stuff (duffels with tents, clothing, etc), throw it all on the trailer, then set off on our ride. When we arrive at our destination the van + trailer are (normally) waiting for us, so at that point we pitch our tents and get ready for dinner. Cooking is on a shared rotation, so a pair of riders will do the shopping and cooking for a dinner and then the next day&rsquo;s breakfast using a 3-burner gas camping stove. The cooking setup includes a rudimentary dishwashing arrangement &ndash; basically a set of three plastic basins, as well as various other odds and ends.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of our van and trailer. The racks on the roof are great, you can put the whole collection of bikes up there.</p>

<p>&lt;Warning, geeky computer stuff here about how the blog is hosted&gt;</p>
<p>This blog is my first foray into using the static web site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, in combination with a custom domain from <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> and some help from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. There are a zillion different ways to write blogs these days and even more ways to host/serve them, but for better or worse this is what I&rsquo;ve picked out. For now :-).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve intentionally set up a robots.txt file to disable search engine indexing, so in theory it should not get crawled by Google or any other search engine (this is mainly in the interests of privacy, since I&rsquo;ll be posting photos of myself and other riders at various points).</p>
