					<time>Jun 30, 2025</time>

	<p>We are down to seven riders as of today; Chet packed up and left the tour, he is flying back home tomorrow morning. Cause was again not health or injury related, but again probably not something I should delve into on the blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss him, sorry that he won&rsquo;t be able to round out the tour and do the wheel dip. He was one of my favorite people to ride with, and I enjoyed his sense of humor and wisecracks (delivered daily in his gravely voice).  I guess I will have to drink the remainder of the chcolate milk in the cooler now &hellip;</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today of 56 miles, 1000 feet of elevation gain. Nothing too challenging, mostly downhill with a few mild headwinds. Warm weather for our rides now &ndash; it was 62 when we started out, and by the time we rolled into Coburg it was 87 (felt like more in the full sun). Too warm for me &hellip; I definitely miss the nice cool &ldquo;high of 45 degrees&rdquo; days back in April.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Short ride today, 38 miles, but with a 2000 foot climb to start off with, taking us up over McKenzie pass. It was a beautiful ride, really lovely &ndash; weather was cold to start with but warmed up while we climbed. I rode with Chet and Tom for just about the whole day, also Terence (although he tends to hang back a little on the climbs, so we didn&rsquo;t see all that much of him).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another medium ride today, 51 miles, but with a minimum of climbing, 1795 feet elevation gain, 3 hours 41 minutes riding time. It was good to take it easy again.</p>
<p>I had a hard time getting to sleep the night before, there was to much loud traffic from the rodeo (basically people gunning their very large truck engines), it was a while until I fell asleep, and I was a bit late getting up (5:45am).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today, 48 miles, but with 2600 feet of elevation gain in the form of a huge long climb right off the bat. The climb was not too bad, I was able to power up most of it; the remainder of the ride had headwinds but since it was a slight downhill it was not a punishing ride by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>We had  very early start, since we we were staying at a hostel &ndash; no need to take time setting up camp kitchen or taking down tents, etc. At breakfast we all chatted with Dana one of the hostel caretakers; turns out she is a long distance hiker and had all sorts of stores about the PCT, the AZT, and the long trail.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another fairly challenging day, 69 miles, 2800 feet of elevation gain, 5 hours 20 minutes ride time, but (at least for me) a good deal easier than yesterday.</p>
<p>Ride:</p>

<p>I rode with Theo for the first 40 miles or so, that was nice. We chatted about various stuff, I asked him about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfstedentocht">Elfstedentocht</a>, the big ice skating race in the Netherlands (which was last held in 1997) so we talked about that for a while and chewed over various other subjects.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Monster ride today &ndash; 81 miles, 4700 feet of elevation gain, three big climbs, light headwinds on most of it, 6 hours 40 minutes riding time. On paper and in practice it was very challenging, no question.</p>
<p>It was also a day for some certified grade-A crazy behavior on the part of one driver we encountered early in the day. I was riding with Tim and Mike, we were going slowly to warm up and chatting about something or other, and at a certain point we got passed by what looked like a dark red minivan with a mountain bike strapped on the back. The van driver yelled something, which we couldn&rsquo;t make out, but we&rsquo;re so used to these sorts of encounters it barely registered. Usually in these situations the driver is unhappy that they had to slow down to pass the bikes safely, or they just don&rsquo;t like bikes on the road, or whatever.</p>&hellip;

	<p>We lost another one of our riders in Baker City &ndash; Mel departed the tour. Not for health or injury, but for other reasons I don&rsquo;t want to dig into just now.  He left while we were in Baker City; we still have his bike on top of the van (at some point someone will figure out how to ship it back).</p>
<p>I will miss Mel, his was a presence on the tour was one that I greatly appreciated. We had some memorable conversations, and I always enjoyed riding and cooking with him.  Bummed that he won&rsquo;t be there in person for the final wheel dip next week (seems ridiculous, but it is what it is, apparently). I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Finally a nice warm day with no need to carry rain gear! Yay.</p>
<p>It was a not-too-long ride (53 miles) but with plenty of climbing, 3700 feet of elevation gain. Big climb right off the bat coming out of Halfway, but I actually like my climbs early when it is cool, it was enjoyable. Big downhill, a ride in the valley for a while, then we had long section following the Powder river in a steep, narrow, winding canyon. Then another big climb up through the desert and down into the big valley with Baker City in it.</p>&hellip;

	<p>This was an interesting &ldquo;up and down and up&rdquo; ride &ndash; lengthy climb up to the top of a pass, then descent down into Hell&rsquo;s Canyon and along the Snake river, and then another climb getting back up out of the canyon and into the high plains again. Around 60 miles with a chunky 3600 feet of elevation gain. Weather behaved itself for the most part. Stiff headwind for the first 17 or 18 miles of the climb (ugh), but then wind was not really a factor for the remainder. I rode with Mike and Chet on this one.</p>&hellip;
