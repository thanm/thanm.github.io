	<p>A 58 mile ride today with one big climb (Lolo Pass), so reasonably challenging but certainly not a ride that knocked our socks off.</p>
<p>Starting in Missoula we rode south following Route 12, then turned west into the mountains still following 12. It was a steady low-grade uphill until around mile 40, then a reasonably steep (5% maybe) climb up to the summit of the pass.</p>
<p>Shot of Mel next to a marker, this was before the serious climbing began:</p>&hellip;

	<p>Zero day in Missoula, really good to rest my legs and get recharged/reorganized. The usual stuff: laundry, repacking, working on my bike, stretching, napping. I also went out and bought a new bike lock (my old lock is still fine, but I somehow lost the key to it that I brought).</p>
<p>Amy sent me a nice care package with some snacks, a few missing bits of gear, and some key ingredients + recipe for my favorite chicken curry dish (super thoughtful). At this point I have already eaten the snacks :-).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Happy father&rsquo;s day :-)</p>
<p>Came down with a cold&hellip; last night I was having symptoms, and this morning I had a sore throat, congestion, the usual stuff. It was on the mild side though so I decided to go ahead with the ride. I think I made the right decision &ndash; I had enough energy to power my way through the biking in spite of the sniffles (hopefully I can fully recover during our upcoming rest day).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another nice ride in Montana, by the numbers 60 miles and 1500 feet of elevation, but with a big downhill section towards the end, which helped a lot. Very nice clear weather, sky completely cloudless for whole morning and most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The downhill at mile 27 was awesome &ndash; a bit more than seven miles at 7% grade, we were really flying along. The last 25 was a little trying since we had headwinds, but they were fairly mild winds, so no big deal.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another corker of a ride, this one 68 miles and 3780 feet of elevation gain. There were two big climbs each around 1700 or 1800 feet, first one from mile 20 to 30 and the second from mile 30 to 40, definitely a tough ride. I felt pretty good for the first climb but kind of ran out of gas for the second, I had to use my low granny even though the grade never got worse than around 6.5%.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another challenging ride today, they seem to be coming thick and fast in this part of the tour. Gone are the 45 and 50 mile days at least for now.</p>
<p>Bit over 71 miles, about 3000 feet of elevation gain, most of it in the first 10 miles as we headed over a pass at roughly 7k feet. Definitely a lot of work, both on paper and in reality.</p>
<p>The climb to the pass was great &ndash; still cool, good road, sunny and clear, with excellent views back into the Madison River valley behind and to the left.  No wind to speak of on this part of the ride.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Super long cycling day today, 87 miles up to Ennis Montana. It had the potential to be a fearsome ride, but the wind gods were kind to us and we had a slight tailwind the whole way north, which made it a much easier ride (it was also mostly a slight downhill).</p>
<p>A cold start in the Madison campground in Yellowstone; after getting out on the road I wound up zooming ahead of the pack just so that I could get warm by riding faster. I caught up to Tim, rode with him for about 20 miles or so, then he left me behind when I went off to investigate a roadside store.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Rest day in Yellowstone today. This comes on the back of another rest day this past Sunday and a light cycling day on Monday so I am hoping that this will really give my legs a chance to recover from our giant rides last week.</p>
<p>For entertainment most of us piled into the van today and we toured around the park to view the wildlife and see the sights. Got some good bear and bison sightings, that was fun, and we made the obligatory visit to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which I have seen before but appreciated almost as much as the first time (back in 2011).</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Today we had our first cycling day in Yellowstone National Park, it was a good one, not too strenuous but with some excellent scenery &ndash; around 44 miles and a bit less than 2000 feet of elevation gain.</p>
<p>Yellowstone for some reason doesn&rsquo;t allow cyclists to enter the park at the south entrance (?), so we actually wound up piling all our bikes onto the van then hopping in the van ourselves, at which point Dan drove us into the park to Grant Village. From there we cycled north and west to the Madison Junction (in the west part of the park) where we will camp at the Madison campground.</p>&hellip;
