	<p>Last post on the blog, I am wrapping it up.  It was really an amazing adventure; there were some significant challenges and difficult parts, but totally worth it overall.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just arriving at the blog for the first time, try looking first at the <a href="/blog/about">about</a> section, then maybe read the <a href="/blog/posts/15_april_2025/">first post</a> and a few of the riding day posts. Two of my all time favorite riding days were <a href="/blog/posts/29_june_2025/">from Sisters, Oregon to McKenzie Bridge Oregon</a> and <a href="/blog/posts/31_may_2025/">from Fort Collins, Colorado to Rustic Colorado</a>, but heck, there were a ton of other very beautiful rides as well.  The <a href="/blog/posts">posts</a> page lists all the tour days in chronological order, so you can go through the whole thing if that suits you.</p>&hellip;

	<p>[A warning for readers, this post goes into way more granular detail on my cycling gear, camping gear, and clothing than most humans would want &hellip; feel free to disregard and/or move on to something else more interesting.]</p>
<h2 id="general-observations">General observations</h2>
<p>I think one of the bigger surprises for most of the folks on the tour was how much cool/cold weather we had. Especially for those on our ride team coming from warmer climates, this was a rude shock: they were thinking about this trip as a summertime experience, but in fact we had a heck of a lot of cold nights and cool mornings to contend with.  [This was partly due to an earlier start (by three weeks) compared with previous years, and partly just because we were up in the mountains a lot in the second half of the trip.]</p>&hellip;

	<p>One final travel post  &ndash; made it back to Arlington MA after a marathon airplane/airport odyssey; American canceled my flight out of Eugene due to a mechanical failure and I had to get rebooked on United. Didn&rsquo;t roll into Logan until 1am, but when I got there Amy was there to pick me up, super happy to see her.</p>
<p>I am a bit scruffier and a bit lighter, the post-trip weigh-in had me at 160 pounds on the scale, so it looks like I&rsquo;ve dropped a bit over ten pounds. The post-tour version of me:</p>&hellip;

					<time>Jul 2, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Final ride today on the tour! It was a 66 miler with a wheel dip in the Pacific around mile 35 or so, just south of Waldport, total riding time a bit short of five hours. Plenty of elevation gain (3000+), all of it in the form of up-and-down small hills (just a ton of them). Terrain reminiscent of our riding in eastern Ohio.</p>
<p>The first section (30 miles or so) was following the Alsea river down to the coast, a winding two-lane road with not the greatest shoulder, but nice trees and wildlife. Got a good look at a pair of big red-headed woodpeckers a bit before mile 10 or so; riding with Terence and Tom for that section.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another medium ride today, 53 miles, 1500 feet of elevation gain, 4 hours 10 minute in the saddle. Flat with mild headwinds for the first 30 miles, then a really steep 1000 foot climb in the mountains, then a bit of up and down for the remainder.</p>
<p>I rode with Tom and Terence today (no Chet, he is no longer around). We stopped and had a nice cup of coffee in Harrisburg.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>We are down to seven riders as of today; Chet packed up and left the tour, he is flying back home tomorrow morning. Cause was again not health or injury related, but again probably not something I should delve into on the blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss him, sorry that he won&rsquo;t be able to round out the tour and do the wheel dip. He was one of my favorite people to ride with, and I enjoyed his sense of humor and wisecracks (delivered daily in his gravely voice).  I guess I will have to drink the remainder of the chocolate milk in the cooler now &hellip;</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today of 56 miles, 1000 feet of elevation gain. Nothing too challenging, mostly downhill with a few mild headwinds. Warm weather for our rides now &ndash; it was 62 when we started out, and by the time we rolled into Coburg it was 87 (felt like more in the full sun). Too warm for me &hellip; I definitely miss the nice cool &ldquo;high of 45 degrees&rdquo; days back in April.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Short ride today, 38 miles, but with a 2000 foot climb to start off with, taking us up over McKenzie pass. It was a beautiful ride, really lovely &ndash; weather was cold to start with but warmed up while we climbed. I rode with Chet and Tom for just about the whole day, also Terence (although he tends to hang back a little on the climbs, so we didn&rsquo;t see all that much of him).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another medium ride today, 51 miles, but with a minimum of climbing, 1795 feet elevation gain, 3 hours 41 minutes riding time. It was good to take it easy again.</p>
<p>I had a hard time getting to sleep the night before, there was to much loud traffic from the rodeo (basically people gunning their very large truck engines), it was a while until I fell asleep, and I was a bit late getting up (5:45am).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today, 48 miles, but with 2600 feet of elevation gain in the form of a huge long climb right off the bat. The climb was not too bad, I was able to power up most of it; the remainder of the ride had headwinds but since it was a slight downhill it was not a punishing ride by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>We had  very early start, since we we were staying at a hostel &ndash; no need to take time setting up camp kitchen or taking down tents, etc. At breakfast we all chatted with Dana one of the hostel caretakers; turns out she is a long distance hiker and had all sorts of stories about the PCT, the AZT, and the long trail.</p>&hellip;
