      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first real riding day, woohoo! Much excitement for getting started with the real stuff. Of course to get to the real stuff we had to cycle from the Crystal City part of DC up to the start of the towpath which is not far from the Watergate complex.  That was actually more work than I had thought it would be, the small group I was in got lost (trying to follow signs for a detour) but eventually got back on track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Made it to DC and joined up with the tour group. It is a genial crew &amp;ndash; I enjoyed meeting everyone and beginning the process of getting to know them. We have two guides/leaders &amp;ndash; Simona and Dennis, I am sure they are going to be fun to tour with as well. This morning we grabbed our bikes and headed out on a &amp;ldquo;shakedown&amp;rdquo; ride to make sure everyone&amp;rsquo;s equipment is working properly, etc.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the ride:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another training ride yesterday; it was a bit cold and windy but I did a good solid ride (63 miles) to try to prime the pump for my upcoming tour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At mile 61 or thereabouts, however, I started to hear an odd clunking noise coming from my front derailleur, and when I looked down I saw that one of my front chainrings (the smaller one) had almost completely come off &amp;ndash; of the four bolts holding it on, only one was still there. Eeek.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, welcome to the blog I&amp;rsquo;m keeping to document the Trans-America bike ride I&amp;rsquo;m doing this summer. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve created a lot of content using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger/Blogspot&lt;/a&gt;, I decided this time around to &amp;ldquo;roll my own&amp;rdquo; so as to have a bit more control (you can click on the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; link above for more of the grubby details).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A photo of my trusty bike:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJrArLVhnGpVSTUgu6jqAlPfBw9TKDoa/preview&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salsacycles.com/products/2022-cutthroat-c-grx-810-2x&#34;&gt;Salsa Cutthroat&lt;/a&gt;, a bike in theory designed for long-distance gravel rides (in particular the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourdivide.org/&#34;&gt;Tour Divide&lt;/a&gt; route).  Carbon fiber frame to keep the weight down, but in other respects a high level of sturdiness for dealing with rough roads and such.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is my first foray into using the static web site generator &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, in combination with a custom domain from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.squarespace.com/&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; and some help from &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. There are a zillion different ways to write blogs these days and even more ways to host/serve them, but for better or worse this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve picked out. For now :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally set up a robots.txt file to disable search engine indexing, so in theory it should not get crawled by Google or any other search engine (this is mainly in the interests of privacy, since I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting photos of myself and other riders at various points).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
