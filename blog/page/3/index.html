	<p>Long ride today, 72 miles with 2500 feet of elevation gain, but way less punishing than our last long ride &ndash; the winds were favorable and the roads were good. The first 30 miles in particular were very zoomy and pleasant.</p>
<p>At mile 35 we stopped in Terre Haute Indiana, home of ISU; my fellow rider Mike and I had a nice second breakfast at a diner in town.</p>
<p>A big chunk of the riding today was on SR 40, a two-lane highway with a very limited shoulder, so we had to ride carefully and keep a close eye on traffic.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Shorter day today, 55 miles, which I think was a big relief to everyone, we were all still worn out this morning after yesterday&rsquo;s super-challenging ride. Today&rsquo;s ride was also mostly on nice back roads, and the winds were well-behaved, so it was a pleasure all around.</p>
<p>I rode with Mel and Chet today, and spent a fair amount of time in the &ldquo;pack&rdquo;, not trying to push the pace (much needed after yesterday).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Started raining steadily this morning around 5am, so we had our first &ldquo;pack up and go&rdquo; in the rain for the trip (we&rsquo;ve had lots of other rainy episodes, but for some reason not in the morning). I am getting good now at managing dry-bags and garbage bags to keep the wet stuff separate from the dry in my luggage.</p>
<p>At the start:</p>

<p>It was really a beast of a ride today, no question. 71 miles, 2241 elevation, plenty of up and down. First 20 miles in the rain (bit cold too), all geared up, then at some point it cleared and we started peeling off layers. Second 50 miles was into a serious headwind, really challenging in parts. We were also on a busy road (state route 44) for a couple of long sections, including one where there was a not only a tiny shoulder but with rumble strips, and lots of traffic.</p>&hellip;

	<p>My cooking experience last night with Chet was successful but a bit on the messy side &ndash; it started to rain hard partway through the meal prep so we had to kind of dance around in the mud to get it all done.  There were various other mishaps as well but the final product was super tasty &ndash; we made <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025342-one-pot-chicken-meatballs-with-greens">one-pot chicken meatballs with greens</a>.</p>
<p>Good night&rsquo;s sleep last night in Caesar Creek State Park, very quiet. Lots of dew and condensation inside the tent in the morning tho.  Cool weather to start, 48 degrees.</p>&hellip;

	<p>The weather forecast when we looked at it last night was grim &ndash; all of us were steeling ourselves for a &ldquo;rain all day&rdquo; ride, but lo and behold in the morning we had cloudy skies but no precipation, huzzah! We had quick breakfast and headed out (with all our raingear packed along just in case).</p>
<p>Short ride, 52 miles, mostly flat, no headwinds, just a tiny bit of rain &hellip; it was great, a veritable &ldquo;walk in the park&rdquo;.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Zero day in Mount Sterling Ohio.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: rain all day, but heck, it was an off day, no need to ride in the wet stuff, and we had the van to drive us places if we needed to go somewhere.</p>
<p>The group opted to get in the van and travel into Columbus to explore the city en masse, so that was fun.</p>
<p>We visited the REI store, I bought a few more rain-related items (waterproof socks, we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, and some medium-sized dry bags). The it was off to the Columbus Museum of Art, which was pretty decent (they had a nice exhibition on the artist Louise Nevelson).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Slightly soggy start for this ride, but we managed to get organized and on the road at the appointed hour. So far my tent has been handling to wet weather ok. I rode with the gang for an hour or so, then picked up the pace and rode with Mike into Lancaster OH, and then on into Circlevill, a nice medium-sized city where the van was stopped at  Kroer for food shopping.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Lovely sunrise this morning, and it was a good night sleeping, so something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ride was a tough one: 69 miles with 4600 ft elevation gain. I rode with the pack for the first half or so of the ride, we stopped for lunch in the tiny town of Chandlersville. Lo and behold a local boy scout troop had built a little covered pavilion with picnic tables, perfect spot for a break. Across the street was a small and crusty-looking antique nicknack shop; Deb went in to ask if she could use their bathroom, and when she came out she was holding cold bottles of water for all of us (super nice guy there just gave them to us). Shopping in Zanesville at the Riesbeck market (large and well stocked).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Super lovely weather for cycling this morning &ndash; around 49 or 50 at the start, cool breezes, sunshine. We started our ride with a trip across an old suspension ridge to take us over the river and into Ohio. First 10 miles or the ride were a bit twisty and turny but we eventually made our way to some nice country roads and traveled west. Total of 60 miles, today, but real hills this time (3800 feet of elevation gain). Some of the climbs were steep, we had to really work in spots.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Our group was all definitely ready to ride this morning, rest day done with, everyone was packed and ready to hit the road well before schedule. Warm (60) at the start, and sunny.</p>
<p>The ride getting out of Pittsburgh was a bit dicey, we had a very sketchy left turn to get off Carson Ave across a busy highway that was pretty nerve wracking, but we all stuck together in a pack and made it through.</p>&hellip;
