	<p>Very happy I took the motel room option last night &ndash; I woke up a couple of times during the night and each time there was plenty of thunder + lightning + rain visible outside the window. I also found out that one of my teammates also fled to the motel (in his case however it was because his tent collapsed).</p>
<p>Today: another big ride, 76 miles with 3080 elevation gain. Tomorrow we finally have a somewhat shorted ride planned (62 miles) but we&rsquo;ll see whether it&rsquo;s an easy one (everything depends on the wind).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, 75 miles with lots of elevation (4175ft). It was better than it could have been though, since we were heading mostly west and north, and in the westbound segments we had a decent tailwind &ndash; made a huge difference.  Finished in about 5 hours riding time.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning, so not a lot in the way of open cafes and restaurants, and in fact we had a hard time finding anything that was open (in the smaller towns there were gas stations but just basically pumps, no store).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Sunny and windy here in Atchison KS, it is going to be a nice day, although it looks like we&rsquo;ll be blown around quite a bit during the afternoon. With the exception of the bathrooms I like this campground &ndash; the wind keeps the bugs away, and the sleeping conditions are good (cool, quiet). Photo:</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s agenda included a bike ride into town (3 or 4 miles) and a session at the laundromat for an extended laundry session, a pizza lunch, and a side trip to the Amelia Earhart home museum.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today&rsquo;s ride was another really challenging one, on paper even more difficult than the previous day&rsquo;s killer, but to be honest I found it a tiny bit easier, perhaps because it was more predictable (no chaos/mayhem introduced by routing around a bridge closure).</p>
<p>The first 20 miles or so featured nice scenery albeit with plenty of hills, our route took us up to and around a big man-made lake near the town of Smithville. We stopped for a snack in the town of Paradise MO:</p>&hellip;

	<p>Super challenging ride today, 3000+ elevation gain, 68 miles, a substantial chunk with major headwinds. Not a lot of beautiful scenery or wildlife, just basically a ride to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>We crossed over the Missouri again, that was a crazy section &ndash; very strong crosswind with major gusts, so all of us were trying very hard to stay on the shoulder and not get too close to the (small) guardrail.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Back to riding on pavement! Super zoomy ride today, we had a huge tailwind, which was lovely &ndash; getting wafted along as if you were riding an e-bike or something. The route itself was nice too, very slow rolling hills and lots of wide open spaces.</p>
<p>Selfie on the road:</p>

<p>The road in the background is pretty representative of what we had to work with today &ndash; surface ok, but with a nasty loose gravel shoulder, you definitely want to stay off that unless it is an absolute emergency.</p>&hellip;

	<p>One last ride on the Katy trail, around 63 miles this time. Good weather! A bit on the warm side, but the first few hours were cool at least. Good riding, lots of folks riding in spite of the fact that it was a Tuesday morning. We have reached a total of 1263 miles as of the end of this day, so coming up on one third finished in a few days. We are also coming up on our next zero day this weekend, everyone looking forward to that.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Nice long ride (70ish miles) all on the Katy trail today, it was a good one. Light rain during the morning, almost too light for rain gear, so nothing serious. I rode a bit with Simona, a bit with the pack, a bit with Mike, and for a good chunk of the ride I was on my own.</p>
<p>Snack with Chet, Tom, and Deb at the Holzhauers Cafe in Portland MO.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Nice ride today, route distance was 53 miles, but at the end of the day I rode a bit over 60. Very flat, not much in the way of hills. Today was also the first day back (from injury) for our rider Theo &ndash; we looked great out on the bike, it was good to see him.</p>

<p>We had a couple of long stops, one for coffee in Saint Charles, then another stop in the town of Defiance, where there was a nice (and extremely crowded) brew pub.</p>&hellip;

					<time>May 11, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>A short post to reflect on biking gear and such for this trip so far:</p>
<p>At the top of the list is my bike, which has been absolutely rock solid, super happy with it so far. No mechanical issues, it has ridden well, the tires have performed superbly, the various bags have adequate space. Gold star on that front. I was nervous when I started the trip since virtually everyone else on the tour is riding a road bike (mostly Trek Domane&rsquo;s) but my gravel bike with the big tires is doing me just fine.</p>&hellip;
