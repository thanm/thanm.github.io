					<time>Apr 29, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Our group was all definitely ready to ride this morning, rest day done with, everyone was packed and ready to hit the road well before schedule. Warm (60) at the start, and sunny.</p>
<p>The ride getting out of Pittsburgh was a bit dicey, we had a very sketchy left turn to get off Carson Ave across a busy highway that was pretty nerve wracking, but we all stuck together in a pack and made it through.</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 28, 2025</time>

	<p>Rest day here in Pittsburgh PA. It is good to not be under the gun to pack up stuff&hellip; just roll out of bed and move on to whatever is on your agenda.</p>
<p>Great weather here! Enjoying the sunshine. Also, the hotel/hostel that the ACA booked for us, Traveler&rsquo;s Rest, is still amazing &ndash; just a really cool place to stay, highly recommended.</p>
<p>I spent the morning helping Theo (our rider from the Netherlands) wrangle with the people at the cell phone store to get a US cell plan, that was quite the electronic adventure.  I had done a little research ahead of time to make sure his phone was compatible, but there was still a lot of drama and complication. The person behind the counter needed lots of nudging and arm-twisting (I think what they really wanted was for him to buy a new phone, but that was not going to happen).</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 27, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Cold start today, high 30&rsquo;s, but it was decided that we would have a late (1 hour delayed) start since we only had 35ish miles to ride.</p>
<iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=trip&amp;id=275522991&amp;sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>It was an easy ride, cool, a bit of a headwind, but another enjoyable day out in the sunshine (was better than what we had to deal with the previous day). I rode mostly with Mel; we chatted about our kids and places we&rsquo;d visited.</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 26, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>It was steady rain during the night, continuing through breakfast so we all hustled to get our gear and tents packed up wet, always a tricky business. Thankfully it was not a super cold rain, probably about 60 degrees.</p>
<p>We hit the road around 8 and got onto the trail. Very muddy business!  Shoes and bikes all very liberally coated after a couple of hours. Slight downhill ride following the river; we cycled past Ohiopyle (cute little town, very big with white water kayak/raft folks) and then eventually Connelsville (bit less interesting).</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 25, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Nice weather to start the day &ndash; I had a big of trouble sleeping the night before, but my head was clear and I was ready to ride by the time the 8am start time arrived.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the ride startying in Cumberland was fantastic &ndash; first day on the GAP (Great Allegheny Passage) trail, which follows a defunct rail line. First 25 miles or so uphill at a slight grade (2%) and then a long descend (1% grade down) into Confluence. That long downhill was delightful, really nice conditions.</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 24, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>One last day on the C&amp;O Canal Towpath trail.</p>
<p>After all of the chaos and mayhem caused by downed trees from the previous ride, our leaders decided that it would be a good idea to bypass the first few miles of the trail, just to get well and truly away from the tornado damage. So we piled all of the bikes on top of the van, packed all the riders into the inside, and set off to drive to a spot that looked good. With all the packing and organizing this took a while.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long cycling day today, 77 miles &ndash; on gravel no less (eek).</p>
<p>Our guides got up early and had our breakfast ready a bit earlier than the normal 7am, that was good. We headed out on our way.  Today I rode a bit with Deb, we chatted about various things and enjoyed the scenery, then eventually I detached and headed on my own for a good stretch.</p>
<p>Lots of time to observe the Potomac, which is quite a river.  I have seldom seen a river of that size that has so many rocky bits in it &ndash; it seemed as though every time I looked over at it there were collections of jagged rocks sticking just out of the river, with plenty more below to make trouble for boats (I guess the rockiness is probably one of the big reasons they put in the canal).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Our first real riding day, woohoo! Much excitement for getting started with the real stuff. Of course to get to the real stuff we had to cycle from the Crystal City part of DC up to the start of the towpath which is not far from the Watergate complex.  That was actually more work than I had thought it would be, the small group I was in got lost (trying to follow signs for a detour) but eventually got back on track.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Made it to DC and joined up with the tour group. It is a genial crew &ndash; I enjoyed meeting everyone and beginning the process of getting to know them. We have two guides/leaders &ndash; Simona and Dennis, I am sure they are going to be fun to tour with as well. This morning we grabbed our bikes and headed out on a &ldquo;shakedown&rdquo; ride to make sure everyone&rsquo;s equipment is working properly, etc.  Here&rsquo;s a link to the ride:</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another training ride yesterday; it was a bit cold and windy but I did a good solid ride (63 miles) to try to prime the pump for my upcoming tour.</p>
<p>At mile 61 or thereabouts, however, I started to hear an odd clunking noise coming from my front derailleur, and when I looked down I saw that one of my front chainrings (the smaller one) had almost completely come off &ndash; of the four bolts holding it on, only one was still there. Eeek.</p>&hellip;
