	<p>A medium distance ride, 59 miles, 2065 elevation gain, but a good deal more challenging than I had expected; we had gusty head/side winds and it rained intermittently, so we had to dress carefully to avoid getting cold, and there was a fair amount of work involved. Road shoulder was a good size and surface was ok, but lots of traffic with trucks&ndash; grain trucks (we saw a ton of those) and a whole procession of &ldquo;oversized load&rdquo; trucks for some reason.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another fairly easy ride, 53 miles, 1237 elevation gain, and yet again we had reasonable favorable winds. We were following route 6 again the connecting to route 14, one lane each way, wide shoulder the whole way, decent surface, but the traffic was definitely heavy, with plenty of trucks.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the terrain change during this ride &ndash; at the start in the morning it was corn and wheat fields, surroundings virtually identical to what we were seeing in Nebraska &ndash; then at a certain point things start to change, and by the time you hit Sterling it is a completely different look, scrubby vegetation, very mildly rolling hills, ranchland, much drier (more like what I would expect to see around the Denver area.</p>&hellip;

	<p>New state today; Colorado, huzzah!</p>
<p>We had rain last night, ordinarily this would not be especially of interest, but our rider Theo woke up to water dripping noises, and saw that the church roof was leaking, water coming down onto their piano (yikes). Theo woke Arlen, who called the church folks, and a crew materialized a bit later with a big set of tarps and buckets and such to try to catch/redirect the water. They said that the previous month the church roof had been replaced, and the new roof apparently has some &ldquo;issues&rdquo;.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Nice low-intensity ride from McCook to Imperial this morning, we had mild tailwinds for most of it, a tiny bit of rain but mostly just misty/foggy stuff, nothing that would soak our clothing.</p>

<p>We are staying in a Methodist church here in Imperial, yay &ndash; super happy about not having to pitch my tent (especially given that it is supposed to rain tonight).</p>&hellip;

	<p>No mileage today, we are relaxing here in McCook, Nebraska in a motel. It is a pleasure to sleep in a bed and have regular meals cooked by someone else &hellip;</p>
<p>This morning a group of wandered down to the center of town and saw the sights: a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and a couple of museums, including The Museum of the High Plains, and a newer spot called the Art Bank.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Nice breakfast again provided by the lovely folks from the Arapahoe Methodist church, it featured some tasty egg casseroles, along with biscuits and sausage gravy, yum. Rain this morning early, but it had pretty much cleared by the time we hit the road, so the conditions were good. We had a pretty decent tailwind to boot.</p>
<p>None of us were interested in riding very quickly, the pace was leisurely. We stopped in Cambridge NE at a nice coffee shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShirleyKsCoffeeShop">Shirley K&rsquo;s</a>, mug of joe for $1.25 (with refills) and some nice conversations with curious locals. Took our time there.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium-intensity ride today, 60 miles, 2200 feet of elevation gain, heading mostly west and northwest up to Arapahoe, Nebraska. Winds were favorable, mild and out of the northeast for most of the time. The mood of our riders was good, I think everyone is looking forward to a nice weekend, and enjoying the weather, which has been awesome.</p>
<p>Nebraska definitely feels like a &ldquo;big sky&rdquo; country; there were a couple of points where we stopped on the ride and just soaked in the expanse: farmland (corn) from one horizon to another. Still definitely with a drier and scrubbier feel to the vegetation and the terrain.</p>&hellip;

	<p>New state today! We crossed over into Nebraska about a third of the way through our ride, which was to the west and north.  The terrain and vegetation is noticeably different already &ndash; drier, more hay and less corn in the fields (and the corn we see is not as far along), more scrubby trees and bushes, sandier soil.</p>
<p>Much much easier ride than yesterday &ndash; around the same on paper (61 miles, 2500 feet of elevation) but mild headwinds (7-10mph) and as opposed to the gale force stuff we had on our previous ride. I rode with Chet and Mel the whole way &ndash; we had some hijinks, mainly a flat on Chet&rsquo;s rear wheel that proved tricky to fix (we tackled it as a team).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Incredibly challenging ride today, one of the hardest rides I can recall doing.</p>
<p>The cue sheet was dead simple, just get on state route 36 for 63 miles, but the whole stretch had 20-30 mph headwinds with gusts that were stronger, so we had to dig deep for every mile, we really had our rear ends kicked up down and sideways.</p>
<p>I had to pedal hard just to make 10 or 11 mph; on the hills we were down to 6 or 7 mph (total elevation gain 2567). Six and a half hours of riding time, average speed of 10.5 mph. The road was decent overall, most sections had pretty good shoulders and the surface was quite good; traffic was modest except for the last couple of hours.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another big ride, 76 miles with 3080 elevation gain. Tomorrow we finally have a somewhat shorted ride planned (62 miles) but we&rsquo;ll see whether it&rsquo;s an easy one (everything depends on the wind).</p>
<p>Our route took us south from Seneca for about 10 miles, then west from there through Frankfort and Blue Rapids, and then finally north for another 10 mile stretch to Washington.</p>
<p>On the road to Frankfort:</p>

<p>Stopped in Frankfort for a snack at a smal fried chicken place attached to a Casey&rsquo;s (this was surprisingly good stuff):</p>&hellip;
