	<p>Slightly soggy start for this ride, but we managed to get organized and on the road at the appointed hour. So far my tent has been handling to wet weather ok. I rode with the gang for an hour or so, then picked up the pace and rode with Mike into Lancaster OH, and then on into Circlevill, a nice medium-sized city where the van was stopped at  Kroer for food shopping.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Lovely sunrise this morning, and it was a good night sleeping, so something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ride was a tough one: 69 miles with 4600 ft elevation gain. I rode with the pack for the first half or so of the ride, we stopped for lunch in the tiny town of Chandlersville. Lo and behold a local boy scout troop had built a little covered pavilion with picnic tables, perfect spot for a break. Across the street was a small and crusty-looking antique nicknack shop; Deb went in to ask if she could use their bathroom, and when she came out she was holding cold bottles of water for all of us (super nice guy there just gave them to us). Shopping in Zanesville at the Riesbeck market (large and well stocked).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Super lovely weather for cycling this morning &ndash; around 49 or 50 at the start, cool breezes, sunshine. We started our ride with a trip across an old suspension ridge to take us over the river and into Ohio. First 10 miles or the ride were a bit twisty and turny but we eventually made our way to some nice country roads and traveled west. Total of 60 miles, today, but real hills this time (3800 feet of elevation gain). Some of the climbs were steep, we had to really work in spots.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Our group was all definitely ready to ride this morning, rest day done with, everyone was packed and ready to hit the road well before schedule. Warm (60) at the start, and sunny.</p>
<p>The ride getting out of Pittsburgh was a bit dicey, we had a very sketchy left turn to get off Carson Ave across a busy highway that was pretty nerve wracking, but we all stuck together in a pack and made it through.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Rest day here in Pittsburgh PA. It is good to not be under the gun to pack up stuff&hellip; just roll out of bed and move on to whatever is on your agenda.</p>
<p>Great weather here! Enjoying the sunshine. Also, the hotel/hostel that the ACA booked for us, Traveler&rsquo;s Rest, is still amazing &ndash; just a really cool place to stay, highly recommended.</p>
<p>I spent the morning helping Theo (our rider from the Netherlands) wrangle with the people at the cell phone store to get a US cell plan, that was quite the electronic adventure.  I had done a little research ahead of time to make sure his phone was compatible, but there was still a lot of drama and complication. The person behind the counter needed lots of nudging and arm-twisting (I think what they really wanted was for him to buy a new phone, but that was not going to happen).</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 27, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Cold start today, high 30&rsquo;s, but it was decided that we would have a late (1 hour delayed) start since we only had 35ish miles to ride.</p>
<iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=trip&amp;id=275522991&amp;sampleGraph=true" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>It was an easy ride, cool, a bit of a headwind, but another enjoyable day out in the sunshine (was better than what we had to deal with the previous day). I rode mostly with Mel; we chatted about our kids and places we&rsquo;d visited.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>It was steady rain during the night, continuing through breakfast so we all hustled to get our gear and tents packed up wet, always a tricky business. Thankfully it was not a super cold rain, probably about 60 degrees.</p>
<p>We hit the road around 8 and got onto the trail. Very muddy business!  Shoes and bikes all very liberally coated after a couple of hours. Slight downhill ride following the river; we cycled past Ohiopyle (cute little town, very big with white water kayak/raft folks) and then eventually Connelsville (bit less interesting).</p>&hellip;

					<time>Apr 25, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Nice weather to start the day &ndash; I had a big of trouble sleeping the night before, but my head was clear and I was ready to ride by the time the 8am start time arrived.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the ride startying in Cumberland was fantastic &ndash; first day on the GAP (Great Allegheny Passage) trail, which follows a defunct rail line. First 25 miles or so uphill at a slight grade (2%) and then a long descend (1% grade down) into Confluence. That long downhill was delightful, really nice conditions.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>One last day on the C&amp;O Canal Towpath trail.</p>
<p>After all of the chaos and mayhem caused by downed trees from the previous ride, our leaders decided that it would be a good idea to bypass the first few miles of the trail, just to get well and truly away from the tornado damage. So we piled all of the bikes on top of the van, packed all the riders into the inside, and set off to drive to a spot that looked good. With all the packing and organizing this took a while.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Long cycling day today, 77 miles &ndash; on gravel no less (eek).</p>
<p>Our guides got up early and had our breakfast ready a bit earlier than the normal 7am, that was good. We headed out on our way.  Today I rode a bit with Deb, we chatted about various things and enjoyed the scenery, then eventually I detached and headed on my own for a good stretch.</p>
<p>Lots of time to observe the Potomac, which is quite a river.  I have seldom seen a river of that size that has so many rocky bits in it &ndash; it seemed as though every time I looked over at it there were collections of jagged rocks sticking just out of the river, with plenty more below to make trouble for boats (I guess the rockiness is probably one of the big reasons they put in the canal).</p>&hellip;
