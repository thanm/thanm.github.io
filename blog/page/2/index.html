					<time>Jun 5, 2025</time>

	<p>Medium ride today, 59 miles with around 2500 feet of elevation gain. Another spectacular Wyoming vistas ride, lovely scenery, interesting geology, wild horses and deer, not a lot of other human beings (and in particular no shops or cafes to stop at).</p>
<p>Cold in the morning, I had hat + gloves + shell + layers on, but was still working to keep from being too cool. It warmed up a bit in the afternoon and we got some intermittent sunshine.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, 69 miles, about 2000 feet of elevation gain, and some modest headwinds (7-10 mph nothing too intense, but we had them to contend with for the last forty miles or so).</p>
<p>Eastern sky in Rawlins, before the sunrise:</p>

<p>We crossed the continental divide today, somewhat puzzling since the spot where it happened seemed rather undistinguished (just a little hill/ridge).</p>

<p>Lovely scenery on this ride, with lots of interesting changes in the landscape and the geology as the ride progressed. Instead of starting sunny and then clouding up later in the day (the pattern for our last handful of rides) it did the opposite, so when we finally rolled into our destination the weather was almost perfect (high 60&rsquo;s, sunny, light breeze).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Shorter ride today, 45 miles with 1450ft elevation gain, and a bit less in the headwind department today, thankfully. Cool and overcast, maybe 48 degrees when we started, then about 12 miles into the ride the temperature abruptly dropped ten degrees and the wind picked up, yikes.  Mike and I were riding together at that point, we both realized we were absolutely freezing, so we stopped and threw on extra layers, but still cold after that.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Today we rode from Walden Colorado to Saratoga Wyoming, so a new state, huzzah! A total of 69 miles, 2,542 feet of elevation gain &ndash; a fairly challenging ride by the numbers.</p>
<p>The landscape changed a bit as we rode north, maybe a bit drier and vegetation more scrubby than the North Park area we were in before.</p>
<p>Weather-wise this was a &ldquo;Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde&rdquo; ride &ndash; first 30 miles (kindly Dr Jeckyl) we had a modest tailwind, sailing along with ease. Then lo and behold around the 30 mile mark the wind turned around and we were riding into a 7-10mph headwind (horrible Mr Hyde). Lots of work from then on to keep up a reasonable pace.  Legs pretty sore when we were done&hellip;</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today was the first of our big climbs in the Rockies &ndash; we tackled Cameron pass, at 10,200 feet, as part of a 56 mile to Walden CO (elevation gain 3500 feet whew).</p>
<p>It was a good night&rsquo;s sleep for me at the campground, I woke once around midnight and got a good view of the stars on my way to visit the bathroom. In the morning we had a gusty, dry breeze, meaning that my tent was pretty much dry when I went to pack it up.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Fabulous ride today, really one of the nicest ones yet on the tour if not the best.</p>
<p>Perfect weather, sunny, warm sunshine with cool breezes, decent road conditions (no trucks) but most importantly fabulous scenery. 44 miles or thereabouts, a bit less than 3000 feet of climbing. First part (about 6 miles) was on a bike path leading out of the city, then eventually we switched to SR 14, a two-laner that wound its way up into the mountains.</p>&hellip;

	<p>If there is a better town to have a zero day in, I&rsquo;m not sure I can imagine it &hellip; Fort Collins seems to have it all, nice weather, bikeable streets, free buses, good restaurants, good bike shops, list goes on.</p>
<p>The new sleeping pad that I bought yesterday at REI seems to not fit inside my duffle, as it turns out. Oops.  I think what I will need to do is bungy-cord it to the outside or something to that effect. They had a limited selection, so I had pick from what they had and deal with the fallout.</p>&hellip;

	<p>It was a good vibe this morning, my fellow riders and I were refreshed having spent the night in a high school gym (as opposed to in a tent in the rain), and looking forward to our upcoming zero day. It was cold when we started out but eventually warmed up as we made our way to Fort Collins.</p>
<p>Still on SR 14 for most of the ride, so lots of traffic and beaucoup trucks (ugh) but the shoulder was wide, albeit with debris in some sections.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Another post on gear:</p>
<p>Most of my major gear items still going strong (especially my bike), but in the last few weeks my sleeping pad seems to have developed a slow leak &hellip; I get it all inflated, go to sleep, and in about four hours it has lost most of its oomph.  I am planning on replacing it when we get to Fort Collins, looking forward to that. It was about a five year old pad, so not too much of a surprise that it gave out.</p>&hellip;

	<p>A medium distance ride, 59 miles, 2065 elevation gain, but a good deal more challenging than I had expected; we had gusty head/side winds and it rained intermittently, so we had to dress carefully to avoid getting cold, and there was a fair amount of work involved. Road shoulder was a good size and surface was ok, but lots of traffic with trucks&ndash; grain trucks (we saw a ton of those) and a whole procession of &ldquo;oversized load&rdquo; trucks for some reason.</p>&hellip;
