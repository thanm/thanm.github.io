					<time>Jun 9, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Today we had our first cycling day in Yellowstone National Park, it was a good one, not too strenuous but with some excellent scenery &ndash; around 44 miles and a bit less than 2000 feet of elevation gain.</p>
<p>Yellowstone for some reason doesn&rsquo;t allow cyclists to enter the park at the south entrance (?), so we actually wound up piling all our bikes onto the van then hopping in the van ourselves, at which point Dan drove us into the park to Grant Village. From there we cycled north and west to the Madison Junction (in the west part of the park) where we will camp at the Madison campground.</p>&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Huge cycling day today &ndash; 70 miles, 3700 feet of elevation gain and some pretty consistent, stiff headwinds made for a really exhausting ride (total of seven hours of riding time). We crossed Togwotee pass (elevation 9567), so that was the huge climb for the day. The grades on the climb were not too horrendous, mostly between 4 and 6 percent, but it was a really long haul getting up and over.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, and long day in general &ndash; my  night to cook, so that always adds a whole new level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Our ride was largely uphill, 73 miles with 3592 feet of elevation gain. Our route was to the northwest with the big Wind River mountain range off to our left and the Wind River Indian reservation on our right.</p>
<p>The start of the ride was a bit scary, we had a big bank of dark clouds in the southeast looming over us, and the weather report said 25-30% chance of rain, so I dressed warmly and I packed every bit of my rain gear in my backpack as well as my heavy gloves. Oddly though as we rode north the clouds faded and it turned into a really nice day. Certainly not hot, but warm enough that I could use my lighter gloves and hat.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today, 59 miles with around 2500 feet of elevation gain. Another spectacular Wyoming vistas ride, lovely scenery, interesting geology, wild horses and deer, not a lot of other human beings (and in particular no shops or cafes to stop at).</p>
<p>Cold in the morning, I had hat + gloves + shell + layers on, but was still working to keep from being too cool. It warmed up a bit in the afternoon and we got some intermittent sunshine.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, 69 miles, about 2000 feet of elevation gain, and some modest headwinds (7-10 mph nothing too intense, but we had them to contend with for the last forty miles or so).</p>
<p>Eastern sky in Rawlins, before the sunrise:</p>

<p>We crossed the continental divide today, somewhat puzzling since the spot where it happened seemed rather undistinguished (just a little hill/ridge).</p>

<p>Lovely scenery on this ride, with lots of interesting changes in the landscape and the geology as the ride progressed. Instead of starting sunny and then clouding up later in the day (the pattern for our last handful of rides) it did the opposite, so when we finally rolled into our destination the weather was almost perfect (high 60&rsquo;s, sunny, light breeze).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Shorter ride today, 45 miles with 1450ft elevation gain, and a bit less in the headwind department today, thankfully. Cool and overcast, maybe 48 degrees when we started, then about 12 miles into the ride the temperature abruptly dropped ten degrees and the wind picked up, yikes.  Mike and I were riding together at that point, we both realized we were absolutely freezing, so we stopped and threw on extra layers, but still cold after that.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today we rode from Walden Colorado to Saratoga Wyoming, so a new state, huzzah! A total of 69 miles, 2,542 feet of elevation gain &ndash; a fairly challenging ride by the numbers.</p>
<p>The landscape changed a bit as we rode north, maybe a bit drier and vegetation more scrubby than the North Park area we were in before.</p>
<p>Weather-wise this was a &ldquo;Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde&rdquo; ride &ndash; first 30 miles (kindly Dr Jeckyl) we had a modest tailwind, sailing along with ease. Then lo and behold around the 30 mile mark the wind turned around and we were riding into a 7-10mph headwind (horrible Mr Hyde). Lots of work from then on to keep up a reasonable pace.  Legs pretty sore when we were done&hellip;</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today was the first of our big climbs in the Rockies &ndash; we tackled Cameron pass, at 10,200 feet, as part of a 56 mile to Walden CO (elevation gain 3500 feet whew).</p>
<p>It was a good night&rsquo;s sleep for me at the campground, I woke once around midnight and got a good view of the stars on my way to visit the bathroom. In the morning we had a gusty, dry breeze, meaning that my tent was pretty much dry when I went to pack it up.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Fabulous ride today, really one of the nicest ones yet on the tour if not the best.</p>
<p>Perfect weather, sunny, warm sunshine with cool breezes, decent road conditions (no trucks) but most importantly fabulous scenery. 44 miles or thereabouts, a bit less than 3000 feet of climbing. First part (about 6 miles) was on a bike path leading out of the city, then eventually we switched to SR 14, a two-laner that wound its way up into the mountains.</p>&hellip;
