					<time>Jun 25, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Monster ride today &ndash; 81 miles, 4700 feet of elevation gain, three big climbs, light headwinds on most of it, 6 hours 40 minutes riding time. On paper and in practice it was very challenging, no question.</p>
<p>It was also a day for some certified grade-A crazy behavior on the part of one driver we encountered early in the day. I was riding with Tim and Mike, we were going slowly to warm up and chatting about something or other, and at a certain point we got passed by what looked like a dark red minivan with a mountain bike strapped on the back. The van driver yelled something, which we couldn&rsquo;t make out, but we&rsquo;re so used to these sorts of encounters it barely registered. Usually in these situations the driver is unhappy that they had to slow down to pass the bikes safely, or they just don&rsquo;t like bikes on the road, or whatever.</p>&hellip;

	<p>We lost another one of our riders in Baker City &ndash; Mel departed the tour. Not for health or injury, but for other reasons I don&rsquo;t want to dig into just now.  He left while we were in Baker City; we still have his bike on top of the van (at some point someone will figure out how to ship it back).</p>
<p>I will miss Mel, his was a presence on the tour was one that I greatly appreciated. We had some memorable conversations, and I always enjoyed riding and cooking with him.  Bummed that he won&rsquo;t be there in person for the final wheel dip next week (seems ridiculous, but it is what it is, apparently). I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Finally a nice warm day with no need to carry rain gear! Yay.</p>
<p>It was a not-too-long ride (53 miles) but with plenty of climbing, 3700 feet of elevation gain. Big climb right off the bat coming out of Halfway, but I actually like my climbs early when it is cool, it was enjoyable. Big downhill, a ride in the valley for a while, then we had long section following the Powder river in a steep, narrow, winding canyon. Then another big climb up through the desert and down into the big valley with Baker City in it.</p>&hellip;

	<p>This was an interesting &ldquo;up and down and up&rdquo; ride &ndash; lengthy climb up to the top of a pass, then descent down into Hell&rsquo;s Canyon and along the Snake river, and then another climb getting back up out of the canyon and into the high plains again. Around 60 miles with a chunky 3600 feet of elevation gain. Weather behaved itself for the most part. Stiff headwind for the first 17 or 18 miles of the climb (ugh), but then wind was not really a factor for the remainder. I rode with Mike and Chet on this one.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Lots of rain last night, after it started around dinner time I think it didn&rsquo;t let up for several hours, then went on intermittently for the rest of the night. Mel told me he went out around 11 to use the bathroom and it was snowing?</p>
<p>Thankfully my tent came through ok, no wet gear for me (combination of good tent and carefully picked tent spot). Mike was not so lucky, he had lots of water in his tent and quite a lot of his gear was soaked (judging from my informal survey there were a few others who also had some water in their tents).</p>&hellip;

					<time>Jun 20, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>We had some surprises/curveballs to deal with in our ride planning today.</p>
<p>First was that Simona managed to come down with the cold that Dan and I had (Dan is still wrestling with it, but I am almost done). Bummer&hellip; hope that will be the end of it and that other folks won&rsquo;t get infected.</p>
<p>Second surprise: the original RV park we were going to be riding to in Riggins (&ldquo;Big Eddy&rdquo;) canceled our reservation, so Dan + Simona had to rebook us in a new place. The fallback campground is named &ldquo;Pinehurst&rdquo;, and is about 13 miles past Riggins, so what was originally going to be a 50 mile ride turned into a 63 mile ride. The extra distance today is in fact just fine, since it will make tomorrow&rsquo;s ride into Cambridge much more manageable (no longer 80 but now 67).</p>&hellip;

	<p>A medium ride today (47 miles) but with a hum-dinger of a climb partway through.</p>
<p>First section was along the Lochsa river again, and at this point in the valley it is a huge, enormous thing: still swift and clear, but a real monster of a river.</p>
<p>One interesting thing we saw along the way was a series of places where people had run improvised cable cars from our side of the river to the opposite side &ndash; Mel told me that they don&rsquo;t allow cars on the opposite side, so if you have a house or a farm you need some way to get gear and people across to it.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today was an interesting day in that our group split into two: one gang rode through as usual, and the other group stopped partway to go white-water rafting.</p>
<p>I was kind of on the fence, but eventually decided to skip the rafting &ndash; I am still recovering from my cold (so maybe not great to be dunking myself in 55 degree water), and I needed to spend time working on my bike, which was not going to happen if I went on an excursion.</p>&hellip;

	<p>A 58 mile ride today with one big climb (Lolo Pass), so reasonably challenging but certainly not a ride that knocked our socks off.</p>
<p>Starting in Missoula we rode south following Route 12, then turned west into the mountains still following 12. It was a steady low-grade uphill until around mile 40, then a reasonably steep (5% maybe) climb up to the summit of the pass.</p>
<p>Shot of Mel next to a marker, this was before the serious climbing began:</p>&hellip;

	<p>Zero day in Missoula, really good to rest my legs and get recharged/reorganized. The usual stuff: laundry, repacking, working on my bike, stretching, napping. I also went out and bought a new bike lock (my old lock is still fine, but I somehow lost the key to it that I brought).</p>
<p>Amy sent me a nice care package with some snacks, a few missing bits of gear, and some key ingredients + recipe for my favorite chicken curry dish (super thoughtful). At this point I have already eaten the snacks :-).</p>&hellip;
