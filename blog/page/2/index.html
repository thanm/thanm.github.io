	<p>Another corker of a ride, this one 68 miles and 3780 feet of elevation gain. There were two big climbs each around 1700 or 1800 feet, first one from mile 20 to 30 and the second from mile 30 to 40, definitely a tough ride. I felt pretty good for the first climb but kind of ran out of gas for the second, I had to use my low granny even though the grade never got worse than around 6.5%.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Another challenging ride today, they seem to be coming thick and fast in this part of the tour. Gone are the 45 and 50 mile days at least for now.</p>
<p>Bit over 71 miles, about 3000 feet of elevation gain, most of it in the first 10 miles as we headed over a pass at roughly 7k feet. Definitely a lot of work, both on paper and in reality.</p>
<p>The climb to the pass was great &ndash; still cool, good road, sunny and clear, with excellent views back into the Madison River valley behind and to the left.  No wind to speak of on this part of the ride.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Super long cycling day today, 87 miles up to Ennis Montana. It had the potential to be a fearsome ride, but the wind gods were kind to us and we had a slight tailwind the whole way north, which made it a much easier ride (it was also mostly a slight downhill).</p>
<p>A cold start in the Madison campground in Yellowstone; after getting out on the road I wound up zooming ahead of the pack just so that I could get warm by riding faster. I caught up to Tim, rode with him for about 20 miles or so, then he left me behind when I went off to investigate a roadside store.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Rest day in Yellowstone today. This comes on the back of another rest day this past Sunday and a light cycling day on Monday so I am hoping that this will really give my legs a chance to recover from our giant rides last week.</p>
<p>For entertainment most of us piled into the van today and we toured around the park to view the wildlife and see the sights. Got some good bear and bison sightings, that was fun, and we made the obligatory visit to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which I have seen before but appreciated almost as much as the first time (back in 2011).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Today we had our first cycling day in Yellowstone National Park, it was a good one, not too strenuous but with some excellent scenery &ndash; around 44 miles and a bit less than 2000 feet of elevation gain.</p>
<p>Yellowstone for some reason doesn&rsquo;t allow cyclists to enter the park at the south entrance (?), so we actually wound up piling all our bikes onto the van then hopping in the van ourselves, at which point Dan drove us into the park to Grant Village. From there we cycled north and west to the Madison Junction (in the west part of the park) where we will camp at the Madison campground.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Huge cycling day today &ndash; 70 miles, 3700 feet of elevation gain and some pretty consistent, stiff headwinds made for a really exhausting ride (total of seven hours of riding time). We crossed Togwotee pass (elevation 9567), so that was the huge climb for the day. The grades on the climb were not too horrendous, mostly between 4 and 6 percent, but it was a really long haul getting up and over.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, and long day in general &ndash; my  night to cook, so that always adds a whole new level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Our ride was largely uphill, 73 miles with 3592 feet of elevation gain. Our route was to the northwest with the big Wind River mountain range off to our left and the Wind River Indian reservation on our right.</p>
<p>The start of the ride was a bit scary, we had a big bank of dark clouds in the southeast looming over us, and the weather report said 25-30% chance of rain, so I dressed warmly and I packed every bit of my rain gear in my backpack as well as my heavy gloves. Oddly though as we rode north the clouds faded and it turned into a really nice day. Certainly not hot, but warm enough that I could use my lighter gloves and hat.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Medium ride today, 59 miles with around 2500 feet of elevation gain. Another spectacular Wyoming vistas ride, lovely scenery, interesting geology, wild horses and deer, not a lot of other human beings (and in particular no shops or cafes to stop at).</p>
<p>Cold in the morning, I had hat + gloves + shell + layers on, but was still working to keep from being too cool. It warmed up a bit in the afternoon and we got some intermittent sunshine.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, 69 miles, about 2000 feet of elevation gain, and some modest headwinds (7-10 mph nothing too intense, but we had them to contend with for the last forty miles or so).</p>
<p>Eastern sky in Rawlins, before the sunrise:</p>

<p>We crossed the continental divide today, somewhat puzzling since the spot where it happened seemed rather undistinguished (just a little hill/ridge).</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14WAqaeTwkb8AYlHLz_cvYR_ZqVpx_U5M/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>Lovely scenery on this ride, with lots of interesting changes in the landscape and the geology as the ride progressed. Instead of starting sunny and then clouding up later in the day (the pattern for our last handful of rides) it did the opposite, so when we finally rolled into our destination the weather was almost perfect (high 60&rsquo;s, sunny, light breeze).</p>&hellip;
