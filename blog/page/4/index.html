					<time>May 11, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>A short post to reflect on biking gear and such for this trip so far:</p>
<p>At the top of the list is my bike, which has been absolutely rock solid, super happy with it so far. No mechanical issues, it has ridden well, the tires have performed superbly, the various bags have adequate space. Gold star on that front. I was nervous when I started the trip since virtually everyone else on the tour is riding a road bike (mostly Trek Domane&rsquo;s) but my gravel bike with the big tires is doing me just fine.</p>&hellip;

					<time>May 10, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Today was a final push through Illinois, riding all the way up to the town of Alton (a St Louis suburb) on the banks of the Mississippi. This was about a 75 mile ride, split halfway between SR40/SR140 and a set of smaller roads and bike trails towards the end of the ride. Again we had great riding conditions, sunny, favorable breezes. Today I rode with the Chet, Mel, Tom and Terrence &ndash; they were striking a moderate and not blistering pace (yay).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Lots more riding on SR 40, so we had to ride with care again and watch the traffic carefully.  Good riding conditions though, no headwinds, sunny, weather really quite nice altogether. I rode with Mike for the most part, so pretty zippy speeds.</p>
<p>In Teutopolis IL we spotted a bunch of tents set up outside the Teutopolis Savings Bank, and discovered that they (the TSB employees) were having a charity cookout. We contributed some cash and sat down to have a burger, which was nice.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Long ride today, 72 miles with 2500 feet of elevation gain, but way less punishing than our last long ride &ndash; the winds were favorable and the roads were good. The first 30 miles in particular were very zoomy and pleasant.</p>
<p>At mile 35 we stopped in Terre Haute Indiana, home of ISU; my fellow rider Mike and I had a nice second breakfast at a diner in town.</p>
<p>A big chunk of the riding today was on SR 40, a two-lane highway with a very limited shoulder, so we had to ride carefully and keep a close eye on traffic.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Shorter day today, 55 miles, which I think was a big relief to everyone, we were all still worn out this morning after yesterday&rsquo;s super-challenging ride. Today&rsquo;s ride was also mostly on nice back roads, and the winds were well-behaved, so it was a pleasure all around.</p>
<p>I rode with Mel and Chet today, and spent a fair amount of time in the &ldquo;pack&rdquo;, not trying to push the pace (much needed after yesterday).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Started raining steadily this morning around 5am, so we had our first &ldquo;pack up and go&rdquo; in the rain for the trip (we&rsquo;ve had lots of other rainy episodes, but for some reason not in the morning). I am getting good now at managing dry-bags and garbage bags to keep the wet stuff separate from the dry in my luggage.</p>
<p>At the start:</p>

<p>It was really a beast of a ride today, no question. 71 miles, 2241 elevation, plenty of up and down. First 20 miles in the rain (bit cold too), all geared up, then at some point it cleared and we started peeling off layers. Second 50 miles was into a serious headwind, really challenging in parts. We were also on a busy road (state route 44) for a couple of long sections, including one where there was a not only a tiny shoulder but with rumble strips, and lots of traffic.</p>&hellip;

	<p>My cooking experience last night with Chet was successful but a bit on the messy side &ndash; it started to rain hard partway through the meal prep so we had to kind of dance around in the mud to get it all done.  There were various other mishaps as well but the final product was super tasty &ndash; we made <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025342-one-pot-chicken-meatballs-with-greens">one-pot chicken meatballs with greens</a>.</p>
<p>Good night&rsquo;s sleep last night in Caesar Creek State Park, very quiet. Lots of dew and condensation inside the tent in the morning tho.  Cool weather to start, 48 degrees.</p>&hellip;

	<p>The weather forecast when we looked at it last night was grim &ndash; all of us were steeling ourselves for a &ldquo;rain all day&rdquo; ride, but lo and behold in the morning we had cloudy skies but no precipation, huzzah! We had quick breakfast and headed out (with all our raingear packed along just in case).</p>
<p>Short ride, 52 miles, mostly flat, no headwinds, just a tiny bit of rain &hellip; it was great, a veritable &ldquo;walk in the park&rdquo;.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Zero day in Mount Sterling Ohio.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: rain all day, but heck, it was an off day, no need to ride in the wet stuff, and we had the van to drive us places if we needed to go somewhere.</p>
<p>The group opted to get in the van and travel into Columbus to explore the city en masse, so that was fun.</p>
<p>We visited the REI store, I bought a few more rain-related items (waterproof socks, we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, and some medium-sized dry bags). The it was off to the Columbus Museum of Art, which was pretty decent (they had a nice exhibition on the artist Louise Nevelson).</p>&hellip;

	<p>Slightly soggy start for this ride, but we managed to get organized and on the road at the appointed hour. So far my tent has been handling to wet weather ok. I rode with the gang for an hour or so, then picked up the pace and rode with Mike into Lancaster OH, and then on into Circlevill, a nice medium-sized city where the van was stopped at  Kroer for food shopping.</p>&hellip;
